Bases are colored by DMS reactivity. The model includes the highly conserved stem loops SL1, SL2, SL4, SL5a, SL5b, and SL5c, as well as the more variable stem loops SL3, SL6, SL7, and SL8~\cite{Yang2015a}. The leader transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-L)~\cite{Alonso2002}, upstream open reading frame (uORF)~\cite{Nakagawa2016}, and start codon of ORF1 are also labeled. The model was drawn using VARNA~\cite{Darty2009}. \textbf{(b)}~Receiver operating characteristic curve showing agreement between the DMS reactivities and the secondary structure model; the area under the curve (AUC) is indicated.}
