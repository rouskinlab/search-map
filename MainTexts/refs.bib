The software determines a wide range of conformational parameters, including the identities and rigid-body parameters of interacting bases and base-pair steps, the nucleotides comprising helical fragments, the area of overlap of stacked bases and so on. The reconstruction of three-dimensional structure takes advantage of rigorously defined rigid-body parameters, producing rectangular block representations of the nucleic-acid bases and base pairs and all-atom models with approximate sugar-phosphate backbones. The visualization components create vector-based drawings and scenes that can be rendered as raster-graphics images, allowing for easy generation of publication-quality figures. The utility programs use geometric variables to control the view and scale of an object, for comparison of related structures. The commands run in seconds even for large structures.

Here, a simple method for designing and assembling a 3D scaffolded RNA origami wireframe structure with intrinsic functioning small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) embedded is introduced. Uniquely, the method uses an mRNA fragment as scaffold strand, which is folded by sequence-complementarity of nine shorter synthetic strands. High-yield production of the intended 3D structure is verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Production of functional siRNAs is facilitated by incorporating recognition sites for Dicer at selected locations in the structure, and efficient silencing of a target reporter gene is demonstrated.},

   abstract = {DNA origami is a robust assembly technique that folds a single-stranded DNA template into a target structure by annealing it with hundreds of short 'staple' strands. Its guiding design principle is that the target structure is the single most stable configuration. The folding transition is cooperative and, as in the case of proteins, is governed by information encoded in the polymer sequence. A typical origami folds primarily into the desired shape, but misfolded structures can kinetically trap the system and reduce the yield. Although adjusting assembly conditions or following empirical design rules can improve yield, well-folded origami often need to be separated from misfolded structures. The problem could in principle be avoided if assembly pathway and kinetics were fully understood and then rationally optimized. To this end, here we present a DNA origami system with the unusual property of being able to form a small set of distinguishable and well-folded shapes that represent discrete and approximately degenerate energy minima in a vast folding landscape, thus allowing us to probe the assembly process. The obtained high yield of well-folded origami structures confirms the existence of efficient folding pathways, while the shape distribution provides information about individual trajectories through the folding landscape. We find that, similarly to protein folding, the assembly of DNA origami is highly cooperative; that reversible bond formation is important in recovering from transient misfoldings; and that the early formation of long-range connections can very effectively enforce particular folds. We use these insights to inform the design of the system so as to steer assembly towards desired structures. Expanding the rational design process to include the assembly pathway should thus enable more reproducible synthesis, particularly when targeting more complex structures. We anticipate that this expansion will be essential if DNA origami is to continue its rapid development and become a reliable manufacturing technology.},

In this study, we analyzed the impact of different repair templates on the frequency of homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). We used a stable HEK293 cell line expressing the traffic light reporter (TLR-3) system to quantify HDR and NHEJ events following transfection with Cas9, eight different guide RNAs, and a 1,000 bp donor template generated either as circular plasmid, as linearized plasmid with long 3' or 5' backbone overhang, or as PCR product. The sequence to be corrected was either centrally located (RS55), with a shorter 5' homologous region (RS37), or with a shorter 3' homologous region (RS73). Guide RNAs targeting the transcriptionally active strand (T5, T7) showed significantly higher NHEJ frequencies compared with guide RNAs targeting the transcriptionally inactive strand. HDR activity was highest when using the linearized plasmid with the short 5' backbone overhang and the RS37 design. The results demonstrate the importance of the design of the guide RNA and template DNA on the frequency of DNA repair events and, ultimately, on the outcome of treatment approaches using HDR.},

Previous experiments have shown that RlmM is active on 23S rRNA from an RlmM knockout strain but not on mature 50S subunits from the same strain. Here, we demonstrate RlmM methyltransferase (MTase) activity on in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA and its domain V. We have solved crystal structures of E. coli RlmM at 1.9 Å resolution and of an RlmM-AdoMet complex at 2.6 Å resolution. RlmM consists of an N-terminal THUMP domain and a C-terminal catalytic Rossmann-like fold MTase domain in a novel arrangement. The catalytic domain of RlmM is closely related to YiiB, TlyA and fibrillarins, with the second K of the catalytic tetrad KDKE shifted by two residues at the C-terminal end of a beta strand compared with most 2'O MTases. The AdoMet-binding site is open and shallow, suggesting that RNA substrate binding may be required to form a conformation needed for catalysis. A continuous surface of conserved positive charge indicates that RlmM uses one side of the two domains and the inter-domain linker to recognize its RNA substrate. © 2012 The Author(s).},

In the traditional 2° structure, the center of the 23S rRNA is an extended single strand, which in 3D is seen to be compact and double helical. Accurately assigning nucleotides to helices compels a revision of the 23S rRNA 2° structure. Unlike the traditional 2° structure, the revised 2° structure of the 23S rRNA shows architectural similarity with the 16S rRNA. The revised 2° structure also reveals a clear relationship with the 3D structure and is generalizable to rRNAs of other species from all three domains of life. The 2° structure revision required us to reconsider the domain architecture. We partitioned the 23S rRNA into domains through analysis of molecular interactions, calculations of 2D folding propensities and compactness. The best domain model for the 23S rRNA contains seven domains, not six as previously ascribed. Domain 0 forms the core of the 23S rRNA, to which the other six domains are rooted.

   abstract = {The ribosome is a ribonucleoprotein machine responsible for protein synthesis. In all kingdoms of life it is composed of two subunits, each built on its own ribosomal RNA (rRNA) scaffold. The independent but coordinated functions of the subunits, including their ability to associate at initiation, rotate during elongation, and dissociate after protein release, are an established model of protein synthesis. Furthermore, the bipartite nature of the ribosome is presumed to be essential for biogenesis, since dedicated assembly factors keep immature ribosomal subunits apart and prevent them from translation initiation. Free exchange of the subunits limits the development of specialized orthogonal genetic systems that could be evolved for novel functions without interfering with native translation. Here we show that ribosomes with tethered and thus inseparable subunits (termed Ribo-T) are capable of successfully carrying out protein synthesis. By engineering a hybrid rRNA composed of both small and large subunit rRNA sequences, we produced a functional ribosome in which the subunits are covalently linked into a single entity by short RNA linkers. Notably, Ribo-T was not only functional in vitro, but was also able to support the growth of Escherichia coli cells even in the absence of wild-type ribosomes. We used Ribo-T to create the first fully orthogonal ribosome-messenger RNA system, and demonstrate its evolvability by selecting otherwise dominantly lethal rRNA mutations in the peptidyl transferase centre that facilitate the translation of a problematic protein sequence. Ribo-T can be used for exploring poorly understood functions of the ribosome, enabling orthogonal genetic systems, and engineering ribosomes with new functions.},

The Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-transfer-RNA synthetase-tRNA CUA (MjTyrRS-tRNA CUA) and the Methanosarcina barkeri pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA CUA (MbPylRS-tRNA CUA) orthogonal pairs have been evolved to incorporate a range of unnatural amino acids in response to the amber codon in Escherichia coli. However, the potential of synthetic genetic code expansion is generally limited to the low efficiency incorporation of a single type of unnatural amino acid at a time, because every triplet codon in the universal genetic code is used in encoding the synthesis of the proteome. To encode efficiently many distinct unnatural amino acids into proteins we require blank codons and mutually orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pairs that recognize unnatural amino acids and decode the new codons. Here we synthetically evolve an orthogonal ribosome (ribo-Q1) that efficiently decodes a series of quadruplet codons and the amber codon, providing several blank codons on an orthogonal messenger RNA, which it specifically translates. By creating mutually orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pairs and combining them with ribo-Q1 we direct the incorporation of distinct unnatural amino acids in response to two of the new blank codons on the orthogonal mRNA. Using this code, we genetically direct the formation of a specific, redox-insensitive, nanoscale protein cross-link by the bio-orthogonal cycloaddition of encoded azide-and alkyne-containing amino acids. Because the synthetase-tRNA pairs used have been evolved to incorporate numerous unnatural amino acids, it will be possible to encode more than 200 unnatural amino acid combinations using this approach. As ribo-Q1 independently decodes a series of quadruplet codons, this work provides foundational technologies for the encoded synthesis and synthetic evolution of unnatural polymers in cells. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Although multicomponent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nanostructures, unimolecular folding has seen limited progress.We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted structure that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally construct diverse multikilobase single-stranded structures, including a ∼10, 000-nucleotide (nt) DNA structure and a ∼6000-nt RNA structure. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for constructing complex and replicable nucleic acid nanostructures, and expands the design space and material scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.},

It remains difficult, however, to construct DNA assemblies that are also functional. Incorporating RNA is a promising strategy to circumvent this issue as RNA is structurally related to DNA but exhibits rich chemical, structural and functional diversities. However, only a few examples of rationally designed RNA structures have been reported. Herein, we describe a simple, general strategy for the de novo design of nanostructures in which the self-assembly of RNA strands is programmed by DNA strands. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we have designed and constructed three different RNA-DNA hybrid branched nanomotifs (tiles), which readily assemble into one-dimensional nanofibres, extended two-dimensional arrays and a discrete three-dimensional object. The current strategy could enable the integration of the precise programmability of DNA with the rich functionality of RNA. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

While the breadth of structures that have been produced is impressive, one of the remaining challenges, especially for DNA origami structures that are intended to carry out useful biomedical tasks in vivo, is to endow them with the ability to detect and respond to molecules of interest. Target molecules may be disease indicators or cell surface receptors, and the responses may include conformational changes leading to the release of therapeutically relevant cargo. Nucleic acid aptamers are ideally suited to this task and are beginning to be used in DNA origami designs. In this review, we consider examples of uses of DNA aptamers in DNA origami structures and summarise what is currently understood regarding aptamer-origami integration. We review three major roles for aptamers in such applications: protein immobilisation, triggering of structural transformation, and cell targeting. Finally, we consider future perspectives for DNA aptamer integration with DNA origami.},

   abstract = {Antijunctions and mesojunctions are new classes of multistranded DNA complexes. They represent a generalization of DNA branched junction complexes, such as the Holliday recombination intermediate. Each strand of a conventional branched junction participates in two different double helices, and this is also true for mesojunctions and antijunctions. The helix axes of conventional branched junction complexes may be drawn to converge at a point, but this convergence occurs for lines drawn perpendicular to the helix axes of antijunctions. Mesojunctions are complexes that mix these features of junctions and antijunctions. Antijunction complexes require an even number of strands. We have synthesized the mesojunction containing three strands, the two mesojunctions containing four strands, and the antijunction containing four strands; we compare them with branched junctions containing three and four strands, derived by permutations of the same sequences. Each double helix is designed to contain 1.5 turns of DNA. A tendency to oligomerize makes it difficult to capture antijunctions and mesojunctions in stable discrete complexes, in contrast to conventional branched junctions. For both three-strand and four-strand complexes, Tmis highest for conventional branched junctions. Ferguson analysis indicates similarities in the occluded surface area of junctions, antijunctions, and one four-strand mesojunction, but the other four-strand mesojunction has a much lower apparent surface area. Hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns suggest that the four-strand antijunction and the low-surface-area four-strand mesojunction form stacking domains, analogous to the behavior of conventional branched junctions. These new structures are related to replicational and recombinational intermediates and to single-stranded nucleic acid knots. © 1992, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

We model hexagonal nanotubes made of 6 dsRNA (RNTs) connected by double crossover (DX) at different positions. Using several hundred nano-second (ns) long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we study the atomic structure, conformational change and elastic properties of RNTs in the presence of explicit water and ions. Based on several structural quantities such as root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), we find that the RNTs are almost as stable as DNA nanotubes (DNTs). Although the central portion of the RNTs maintain its cylindrical shape, both the terminal regions open up to give rise to a gating like behavior which can play a crucial role in drug delivery. From the bending angle distribution, we observe that the RNTs are more flexible than DNTs. The calculated persistence length of the RNTs is in the micron range which is an order of magnitude higher than that of a single dsRNA. The stretch modulus of the RNTs from the contour length distribution is in the range of 4-7 nN depending on the sequence. The calculated persistence length and stretch modulus are in the same range of values as in the case of DNTs. To understand the structural properties of RNTs at the individual base-pair level we have also calculated all the helicoidal parameters and analyzed the relative flexibility and rigidity of RNTs having a different sequence. These findings emphasized the fascinating properties of RNTs which will expedite further theoretical and experimental studies in this field.},

These DNA molecules contain four double helices that flank a central branch point, so that each of the four strands that constitute the junction is associated with two different helices. Previously, we have shown that such branched junctions are a special subset of the class of DNA molecules containing multiple strands, in which each strand is associated with two double helices [Du, S. M., Zhang, S., \& Seeman, N. C. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 10955-10963], Conventional branched molecules, such as the Holliday junction, contain helices whose axes can all be drawn to radiate from a central point. The other molecules of the class contain helices whose axes are circumferential about the central point. If all of the helices are circumferential, the molecule is called an antijunction; if the molecule contains a mixture of radial and circumferential helices, it is called a mesojunction. The properties of the molecule are a function of the even or odd nature of the number of helical half-turns in the circumferential helices. Previously, a four-strand antijunction and three-strand and four-strand mesojunctions containing three half-turns (16 nucleotide pairs) per helix were constructed and characterized. Here, we have attempted to construct the analogous molecules containing two half-turns (10 nucleotide pairs) in each helix. The three-strand mesojunction and the four-strand antijunction are not stable under conditions suitable for analysis. We have characterized the two four-strand mesojunctions that are stable by Ferguson analysis, thermal denaturation, and Fe(II)EDTA2- autofootprinting.

Comparison of several steric-block oligo types shows the properties of Morpholinos provide significant advantages over other potential splice-blocking oligos. The procedures and complications of designing effective splice-blocking Morpholino oligos are described. The design process requires complete pre-mRNA sequence for defining suitable targets, which usually generate specific predictable messengers. To validate the targeting procedure, the level and nature of transcript alteration is characterized by RT-PCR analysis of splice modification in a β-globin splice model system. An oligo-walking study reveals that while U1 and U2 small nuclear RiboNucleoProtein (snRNP) binding sites are the most effective targets for blocking splicing, inclusion of these sites is not required to achieve effective splice modifications. The most effective targeting strategy employs simultaneously blocking snRNP binding sites and splice-junctions.

   abstract = {A split aptamer for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was embedded as a recognition unit into two levers of a nanomechanical DNA origami construct by extension and modification of selected staple strands. An additional optical module in the stem of the split aptamer comprised two different cyanine-styryl dyes that underwent an energy transfer from green (donor) to red (acceptor) emission if two ATP molecules were bound as target molecule to the recognition module and thereby brought the dyes in close proximity. As a result, the ATP as a target triggered the DNA origami shape transition and yielded a fluorescence color change from green to red as readout. Conventional atomic force microscopy (AFM) images confirmed the topology change from the open form of the DNA origami in the absence of ATP into the closed form in the presence of the target molecule. The obtained closed/open ratios in the absence and presence of target molecules tracked well with the fluorescence color ratios and thereby validated the bicolor fluorescence readout. The correct positioning of the split aptamer as the functional unit farthest away from the fulcrum of the DNA origami was crucial for the aptasensing by fluorescence readout. The fluorescence color change allowed additionally to follow the topology change of the DNA origami aptasensor in real time in solution. The concepts of fluorescence energy transfer for bicolor readout in a split aptamer in solution, and AFM on surfaces, were successfully combined in a single DNA origami construct to obtain a bimodal readout. These results are important for future custom DNA devices for chemical-biological and bioanalytical purposes because they are not only working as simple aptamers but are also visible by AFM on the single-molecule level.},

Here, we present crystal structures of RlmJ in apo form, in complex with the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine and in complex with S-adenosyl-homocysteine plus the substrate analogue adenosine monophosphate (AMP). RlmJ displays a variant of the Rossmann-like methyltransferase (MTase) fold with an inserted helical subdomain. Binding of cofactor and substrate induces a large shift of the N-terminal motif X tail to make it cover the cofactor binding site and trigger active-site changes in motifs IV and VIII. Adenosine monophosphate binds in a partly accommodated state with the target N6 atom 7 Å away from the sulphur of AdoHcy. The active site of RlmJ with motif IV sequence 164DPPY167 is more similar to DNA m 6A MTases than to RNA m62A MTases, and structural comparison suggests that RlmJ binds its substrate base similarly to DNA MTases T4Dam and M.TaqI. RlmJ methylates in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA, as well as a minimal substrate corresponding to helix 72, demonstrating independence of previous modifications and tertiary interactions in the RNA substrate.

   abstract = {Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were first discovered to influence RNA processing and modulate protein expression over two decades ago; however, progress translating these agents into the clinic has been hampered by inadequate target engagement, insufficient biological activity, and off-target toxic effects. Over the years, novel chemical modifications of ASOs have been employed to address these issues. These modifications, in combination with elucidation of the mechanism of action of ASOs and improved clinical trial design, have provided momentum for the translation of ASO-based strategies into therapies. Many neurological conditions lack an effective treatment; however, as research progressively disentangles the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases, they provide an ideal platform to test ASO-based strategies. This steady progress reached a pinnacle in the past few years with approvals of ASOs for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which represent landmarks in a field in which disease-modifying therapies were virtually non-existent. With the rapid development of improved next-generation ASOs toward clinical application, this technology now holds the potential to have a dramatic effect on the treatment of many neurological conditions in the near future.},

By using a 2H-edited nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach, we determined the structure of a 155-nucleotide region of the leader that is independently capable of directing packaging (core encapsidation signal; ΨCES). The RNA adopts an unexpected tandem three-way junction structure, in which residues of the major splice donor and translation initiation sites are sequestered by long-range base pairing and guanosines essential for both packaging and high-affinity binding to the cognate Gag protein are exposed in helical junctions. The structure reveals how translation is attenuated, Gag binding promoted, and unspliced dimeric genomes selected, by the RNA conformer that directs packaging.},

   abstract = {The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties. ©2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

At the 3' end, generation of a restriction site for linearization required the addition of 2 adenosine residues to the mature 23S sequence.

Two mutations in nsP2 and nsP3 enhanced transgene expression, while three mutations in nsP3 regulated this expression. Replicons containing the most effective mutation combinations showed enhanced duration and cargo gene expression in vivo. In comparison to wildtype replicon, mutants expressing IL-2 injected into murine B16F10 melanoma showed 5.5-fold increase in intratumoral IL-2 and 2.1-fold increase in infiltrating CD8 T cells, resulting in significantly slowed tumor growth.

These probes produced discrimination factors between 3 and 100+ (median, 26).

By taking into account structural fluctuations, we can determine structures with improved detail compared to previous work. To interpret the experimental cryo-EM maps, we present molecular-dynamics-based methods for building pseudo-atomic models in a semi-automated fashion. Among other features, our data allows discerning details such as helical grooves, single-strand versus double-strand crossovers, backbone phosphate positions, and single-strand breaks.

One obstacle to applications concerns the constrained environmental conditions at which DNA objects retain their structure. We present a general, site-selective, and scalable method for creating additional covalent bonds that increase the structural stability of DNA nanostructures. Placement of thymidines in close proximity within DNA nanostructures allows the rational creation of sites for covalent cyclo-butane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) bonds induced via ultraviolet irradiation. The additional covalent bonds may be used in a sequence-programmable fashion to link free strand termini, to bridge strand breaks at crossover sites, and to create additional interhelical connections. Thus designed multilayer DNA origami objects can remain stable at temperatures up to 90°C and in pure double-distilled water with no additional cations present. In addition, these objects show enhanced resistance against nuclease activity. Cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis of non–cross-linked and cross-linked objects indicated that the global shape and the internal network of crossovers are preserved after irradiation. A cryo-EM map of a CPD-stabilized multilayer DNA origami object determined at physiological ionic strength reveals a substantial swelling behavior, presumably caused by repulsive electrostatic forces that, without covalent stabilization, would cause disassembly at low ionic strength. Our method opens new avenues for applications of DNA nanostructures in a wider range of conditions.},

   abstract = {RNA nanoparticles have applications in the treatment of cancers and viral infection; however, the instability of RNA nanoparticles has hindered their development for therapeutic applications. The lack of covalent linkage or crosslinking in nanoparticles causes dissociation in vivo. Here we show that the packaging RNA of bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor can be assembled from 3-6 pieces of RNA oligomers without the use of metal salts. Each RNA oligomer contains a functional module that can be a receptor-binding ligand, aptamer, short interfering RNA or ribozyme. When mixed together, they self-assemble into thermodynamically stable tri-star nanoparticles with a three-way junction core. These nanoparticles are resistant to 8 M urea denaturation, are stable in serum and remain intact at extremely low concentrations. The modules remain functional in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the three-way junction core can be used as a platform for building a variety of multifunctional nanoparticles. We studied 25 different three-way junction motifs in biological RNA and found only one other motif that shares characteristics similar to the three-way junction of phi29 pRNA. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A variety of programmable RNA nanoparticles with defined shape, size, and stoichiometry have been developed for diverse applications in nanobiotechnology. The rising popularity of RNA nanoparticles is due to a number of factors: (1) removing the concern of RNA degradation in vitro and in vivo by introducing chemical modification into nucleotides without significant alteration of the RNA property in folding and self-assembly; (2) confirming the concept that RNA displays very high thermodynamic stability and is suitable for in vivo trafficking and other applications; (3) obtaining the knowledge to tune the immunogenic properties of synthetic RNA constructs for in vivo applications; (4) increased understanding of the 4D structure and intermolecular interaction of RNA molecules; (5) developing methods to control shape, size, and stoichiometry of RNA nanoparticles; (6) increasing knowledge of regulation and processing functions of RNA in cells; (7) decreasing cost of RNA production by biological and chemical synthesis; and (8) proving the concept that RNA is a safe and specific therapeutic modality for cancer and other diseases with little or no accumulation in vital organs. Other applications of RNA nanotechnology, such as adapting them to construct 2D, 3D, and 4D structures for use in tissue engineering, biosensing, resistive biomemory, and potential computer logic gate modules, have stimulated the interest of the scientific community.

The development of sophisticated and precise objects with this technique requires detailed experimental feedback on the structure and composition of assembled objects.

The method relies on measuring the content of unpaired DNA bases in self-assembled DNA objects using a fluorescent de-Bruijn probe for three-base 'codons', which enables a comparison with the designed content of unpaired DNA. We use the assay to measure the quality of assembly of several multilayer DNA origami objects and illustrate the use of the assay for the rational refinement of assembly protocols. Our data suggests that large and complex objects like multilayer DNA origami can be made with high strand integration quality up to 99\%. Beyond DNA nanotechnology, we speculate that the ability to discriminate unpaired from paired nucleic acids in the same macromolecule may also be useful for analysing cellular nucleic acids. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Correlative microscopy, where two or more microscopies are combined to characterize the same sample, is an approach to overcome the limitations of individual techniques, yet it has seen limited use for DNA nanotechnology. We have developed an accessible strategy for high resolution, correlative DNA-based points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) super-resolution and atomic force microscopy (AFM) of DNA nanostructures, enabled by a simple and robust method to selectively bind DNA origami to cover glass. Using this technique, we examined addressable "docking"sites on DNA origami to distinguish between two defect scenarios-structurally incorporated but inactive docking sites, and unincorporated docking sites. We found that over 75\% of defective docking sites were incorporated but inactive, suggesting unincorporated strands played a minor role in limiting the availability of addressable sites. We further explored the effects of strand purification, UV irradiation, and photooxidation on availability, providing insight on potential sources of defects and pathways toward improving the fidelity of DNA nanostructures.},

In our approach, the vertices are represented by n×4 multi-arm junctions (n=2-10) with controlled angles, and the lines are represented by antiparallel DNA crossover tiles of variable lengths. Scaffold strands are used to integrate the vertices and lines into fully assembled structures displaying intricate architectures.

Despite tremendous advancements in NANP development, their immunotoxicity, one of the major impediments in clinical translation of traditional therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs), has never been fully characterized. Here, we describe the first systematically studied immunological recognition of 25 representative RNA and DNA NANPs selected to have different design principles and physicochemical properties. We discover that, unlike traditional TNAs, NANPs used without a delivery carrier are immunoquiescent. We show that interferons (IFNs) are the key cytokines triggered by NANPs after their internalization by phagocytic cells, which agrees with predictions based on the experiences with TNAs. However, in addition to type I IFNs, type III IFNs also serve as reliable biomarkers of NANPs, which is usually not characteristic of TNAs. We show that overall immunostimulation relies on NANP shapes, connectivities, and compositions. We demonstrate that, like with traditional TNAs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells serve as the primary interferon producers among all peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with NANPs, and scavenger receptor-mediated uptake and endosomal Toll-like receptor signaling are essential for NANP immunorecognition. The TLR involvement, however, is different from that expected for traditional TNA recognition. Based on these results, we suggest that NANP technology may serve as a prototype of auxiliary molecular language for communication with the immune system and the modulation of immune responses.},

   abstract = {Anticoagulants are commonly utilized during surgeries and to treat thrombotic diseases like stroke and deep vein thrombosis. However, conventional anticoagulants have serious side-effects, narrow therapeutic windows, and lack safe reversal agents (antidotes). Here, an alternative RNA origami displaying RNA aptamers as target-specific anticoagulant is described. Improved design and construction techniques for self-folding, single-molecule RNA origami as a platform for displaying pre-selected RNA aptamers with precise orientational and spatial control are reported. Nuclease resistance is added using 2'-fluoro-modified pyrimidines during in vitro transcription. When four aptamers are displayed on the RNA origami platform, the measured thrombin inhibition and anticoagulation activity is higher than observed for free aptamers, ssRNA-linked RNA aptamers, and RNA origami displaying fewer aptamers. Importantly, thrombin inhibition is immediately switched off by addition of specific reversal agents. Results for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and single-stranded peptide nucleic acid (PNA) antidotes show restoration of 63\% and 95\% coagulation activity, respectively. To demonstrate potential for practical, long-term storage for clinical use, RNA origami is freeze-dried, and stored at room temperature. Freshly produced and freeze-dried RNA show identical levels of activity in coagulation assays. Compared to current commercial intravenous anticoagulants, RNA origami-based molecules show promise as safer alternatives with rapid activity switching for future therapeutic applications.},

Complex scaffold and staple routing needed to design wireframe DNA origami objects, however, render fully automated, geometry-based sequence design approaches essential for their synthesis. And wireframe DNA origami structural fidelity can be limited by wireframe edges that are composed only of one or two duplexes. Here we introduce a fully automated computational approach that programs 2D wireframe origami assemblies using honeycomb edges composed of six parallel duplexes. These wireframe assemblies show enhanced structural fidelity from electron microscopy-based measurement of programmed angles compared with identical geometries programmed using dual-duplex edges. Molecular dynamics provides additional theoretical support for the enhanced structural fidelity observed. Application of our top-down sequence design procedure to a variety of complex objects demonstrates its broad utility for programmable 2D nanoscale materials.},

However, the complex DNA sequence design needed for the synthesis of these versatile DNA-NPs has limited their widespread use to date. While the automated sequence design algorithms DAEDALUS and vHelix-BSCOR apply to DNA-NPs synthesized using either uniformly dual or hybrid single-dual duplex edges, respectively, these DNA-NPs are relatively compliant mechanically and are therefore of limited utility for some applications. Further, these algorithms are incapable of handling DNA-NP edge designs composed of more than two duplexes, which are needed to enhance DNA-NP mechanical stiffness. As an alternative, here we introduce the scaffolded DNA origami sequence design algorithm TALOS, which is a generalized procedure for the fully automated design of wireframe 3D polyhedra composed of edges of any cross section with an even number of duplexes, and apply it to DNA-NPs composed uniformly of single honeycomb edges. We also introduce a multiway vertex design that enables the fabrication of DNA-NPs with arbitrary edge lengths and vertex angles and apply it to synthesize a highly asymmetric origami object. Sequence designs are demonstrated to fold robustly into target DNA-NP shapes with high folding efficiency and structural fidelity that is verified using single particle cryo-electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction. In order to test its generality, we apply TALOS to design an in silico library of over 200 DNA-NPs of distinct symmetries and sizes, and for broad impact, we also provide the software as open source for the generation of custom NP designs.},

Since then, and especially since the introduction of the origami technique, DNA nanotechnology has enabled increasingly more complex structures. But although general approaches for creating DNA origami polygonal meshes and design software are available, there are still important constraints arising from DNA geometry and sense/antisense pairing, necessitating some manual adjustment during the design process. Here we present a general method of folding arbitrary polygonal digital meshes in DNA that readily produces structures that would be very difficult to realize using previous approaches. The design process is highly automated, using a routeing algorithm based on graph theory and a relaxation simulation that traces scaffold strands through the target structures. Moreover, unlike conventional origami designs built from close-packed helices, our structures have a more open conformation with one helix per edge and are therefore stable under the ionic conditions usually used in biological assays.},

A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by 'top-down' methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide 'staple strands' to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex). © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

These systems also illustrate a common difficulty for hybrid devices: although many proof-of-principle devices exist, practical applications face the challenge of how to incorporate large numbers of chemically diverse functional components into microfabricated resonators at precise locations. Here we show that the directed self-assembly of DNA origami onto lithographically patterned binding sites allows reliable and controllable coupling of molecular emitters to photonic crystal cavities (PCCs). The precision of this method is sufficient to enable us to visualize the local density of states within PCCs by simple wide-field microscopy and to resolve the antinodes of the cavity mode at a resolution of about one-tenth of a wavelength. By simply changing the number of binding sites, we program the delivery of up to seven DNA origami onto distinct antinodes within a single cavity and thereby digitally vary the intensity of the cavity emission. To demonstrate the scalability of our technique, we fabricate 65,536 independently programmed PCCs on a single chip. These features, in combination with the widely used modularity of DNA origami, suggest that our method is well suited for the rapid prototyping of a broad array of hybrid nanophotonic devices.},

We synthesized DNA-chromophore nanostructures and characterized them with ensemble ultrafast and single-molecule spectroscopy and structure-based modeling. This synthetic approach facilitated independent control over the coupling among the chromophores and between the chromophores and the environment. We demonstrated that the coupling between the chromophores and the environment could enhance exciton transport efficiency, highlighting the key role of the environment in driving exciton dynamics. Control over excitons, as reported here, offers a path toward the development of designer nanophotonic devices. Excitons are the molecular scale currency of electronic energy. Control over excitons and their dynamics enables energy to be harnessed and directed for applications such as light harvesting and molecular electronics. The properties of the excitonic systems depend on intermolecular electrodynamic interactions within the material. In natural light harvesting these interactions are controlled through the precision of protein machinery, which is challenging to replicate synthetically. In this work, we design, build, and characterize synthetic excitonic systems composed of multiple chromophores scaffolded within DNA. By leveraging the nanoscale structural precision of DNA, we control multiple intermolecular interactions and demonstrate the ability of these interactions to enhance the efficiency of exciton transport.

Here, we investigate design principles of three-dimensional wireframe RNA-scaffolded origami rendered as polyhedra composed of dual-duplex edges. We computationally design, fabricate, and characterize tetrahedra folded from an EGFP-encoding messenger RNA and de Bruijn sequences, an octahedron folded with M13 transcript RNA, and an octahedron and pentagonal bipyramids folded with 23S ribosomal RNA, demonstrating the ability to make diverse polyhedral shapes with distinct structural and functional RNA scaffolds. We characterize secondary and tertiary structures using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling and cryo-electron microscopy, revealing insight into both global and local, base-level structures of origami. Our top-down sequence design strategy enables the use of long RNAs as functional scaffolds for complex wireframe origami.</p>},

   abstract = {Internal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is one of the most common and abundant modifications of RNA. However, the biological roles of viral RNA m6A remain elusive. Here, using human metapneumovirus (HMPV) as a model, we demonstrate that m6A serves as a molecular marker for innate immune discrimination of self from non-self RNAs. We show that HMPV RNAs are m6A methylated and that viral m6A methylation promotes HMPV replication and gene expression. Inactivating m6A addition sites with synonymous mutations or demethylase resulted in m6A-deficient recombinant HMPVs and virion RNAs that induced increased expression of type I interferon, which was dependent on the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I, and not on melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Mechanistically, m6A-deficient virion RNA induces higher expression of RIG-I, binds more efficiently to RIG-I and facilitates the conformational change of RIG-I, leading to enhanced interferon expression. Furthermore, m6A-deficient recombinant HMPVs triggered increased interferon in vivo and were attenuated in cotton rats but retained high immunogenicity. Collectively, our results highlight that (1) viruses acquire m6A in their RNA as a means of mimicking cellular RNA to avoid detection by innate immunity and (2) viral RNA m6A can serve as a target to attenuate HMPV for vaccine purposes.},

The user-level programs are better documented, more straightforward to use, and written in the Python scripting language, so advanced users can modify the programs' behavior without any recompilation. A completely rewritten 3D transformation class simplifies translation between Euler angle standards and symmetry conventions. The core C++ library has over 500 functions for image processing and associated tasks, and it is modular with introspection capabilities, so programmers can add new algorithms with minimal effort and programs can incorporate new capabilities automatically. Finally, a flexible new parallelism system has been designed to address the shortcomings in the rigid system in EMAN1. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, we show that, in response to infection by the RNA virus Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 translocates into the cytoplasm to increase m6A modification on virus-derived transcripts and decrease viral dsRNA formation, thereby reducing virus-sensing efficacy by RLRs such as RIG-I and MDA5 and dampening antiviral immune signaling. Meanwhile, the genetic ablation of METTL3 in monocyte or hepatocyte causes enhanced type I IFN expression and accelerates VSV clearance. Our findings thus implicate METTL3-mediated m6A RNA modification on viral RNAs as a negative regulator for innate sensing pathways of dsRNA, and also hint METTL3 as a potential therapeutic target for the modulation of anti-viral immunity.},

However, RBMs can be buried within their local RNA structures, thus inhibiting RNA-protein interactions. N 6 -methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant and dynamic internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA, can be selectively recognized by the YTHDF2 protein to affect the stability of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but how m6 A achieves its wide-ranging physiological role needs further exploration. Here we show in human cells that m6 A controls the RNA-structure-dependent accessibility of RBMs to affect RNA-protein interactions for biological regulation; we term this mechanism "the m6 A-switch". We found that m6 A alters the local structure in mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) to facilitate binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), an abundant nuclear RNA-binding protein responsible for pre-mRNA processing. Combining photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) and anti-m6A immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) approaches enabled us to identify 39,060 m6 A-switches among HNRNPC-binding sites; and global m6 A reduction decreased HNRNPC binding at 2,798 high-confidence m6 A-switches. We determined that these m6 A-switch-regulated HNRNPC-binding activities affect the abundance as well as alternative splicing of target mRNAs, demonstrating the regulatory role of m6 A-switches on gene expression and RNA maturation. Our results illustrate how RNA-binding proteins gain regulated access to their RBMs through m6 A-dependent RNA structural remodelling, and provide a new direction for investigating RNA-modification-coded cellular biology.},

However, laboratory-based methods of developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (e.g., immunized mice, hybridomas, and phage display) are time-consuming and are often unable to target a specific antigen epitope or reach (sub)nanomolar levels of affinity. To this end, we developed Optimal Method for Antibody Variable region Engineering (OptMAVEn) for de novo design of humanized monoclonal antibody variable regions targeting a specific antigen epitope. In this work, we introduce OptMAVEn-2.0, which improves upon OptMAVEn by (1) reducing computational resource requirements without compromising design quality; (2) clustering the designs to better identify high-affinity antibodies; and (3) eliminating intra-antibody steric clashes using an updated set of clashing parts from the Modular Antibody Parts (MAPs) database. Benchmarking on a set of 10 antigens revealed that OptMAVEn-2.0 uses an average of 74\% less CPU time and 84\% less disk storage relative to OptMAVEn. Testing on 54 additional antigens revealed that computational resource requirements of OptMAVEn-2.0 scale only sub-linearly with respect to antigen size. OptMAVEn-2.0 was used to design and rank variable antibody fragments targeting five epitopes of Zika envelope protein and three of hen egg white lysozyme. Among the top five ranked designs for each epitope, recovery of native residue identities is typically 45–65\%.

Three natural aminoacylation identities are represented: valine, histidine, and tyrosine. Paralleling this variety in structure, the roles of TLSs vary widely between different viruses. For Turnip yellow mosaic virus, the TLS must be capable of valylation in order to support infectivity, major roles being the provision of translational enhancement and down-regulation of minus strand initiation. In contrast, valylation of the Peanut clump virus TLS is not essential. An intermediate situation seems to exist for Brome mosaic virus, whose RNAs 1 and 2, but not RNA 3, need to be capable of tyrosylation to support infectivity. Other known roles for certain TLSs include: (i) the recruitment of host CCA nucleotidyltransferase as a telomerase to maintain intact 3' CCA termini, (ii) involvement in the encapsidation of viral RNAs, and (iii) presentation of minus strand promoter elements for replicase recognition. In the latter role, the promoter elements reside within the TLS but are not functionally dependent on tRNA mimicry.

Genomic RNA (which also functions as mRNA for the Gag and Gag/Pro/Pol precursor polyproteins) must not splice at all. HIV-1 can tolerate a surprising range in the relative abundance of individual transcript types, and a surprising amount of aberrant and even odd splicing; however, it must not over-splice, which results in the loss of full-length genomic RNA and has a dramatic fitness cost. Cells typically do not tolerate unspliced/incompletely spliced transcripts, so HIV-1 must circumvent this cell policing mechanism to allow some splicing while suppressing most. Splicing is controlled by RNA secondary structure, cis-acting regulatory sequences which bind splicing factors, and the viral protein Rev. There is still much work to be done to clarify the combinatorial effects of these splicing regulators. These control mechanisms represent attractive targets to induce over-splicing as an antiviral strategy. Finally, splicing has been implicated in latency, but to date there is little supporting evidence for such a mechanism. In this review we apply what is known of cellular splicing to understand splicing in HIV-1, and present data from our newer and more sensitive deep sequencing assays quantifying the different HIV-1 transcript types.},

Current vaccines and therapeutic options to control influenza A virus infections are mostly protein-centric and of limited effectiveness. Here, we report using an ensemble defect approach to design mutations to misfold regions of conserved mRNA structures in influenza A virus segments 7 and 8. Influenza A mutant viruses inhibit pre-mRNA splicing and attenuate viral replication in cell culture, thus providing evidence for functions of the targeted regions. Targeting these influenza A viral RNA regions provides new possibilities for designing vaccines and therapeutics against this important human respiratory pathogen.

Native gel analysis, enzymatic/chemical structure probing, and oligonucleotide binding studies of a 63 nt fragment, containing the 3' splice site, key residues of an SF2/ASF splicing factor binding site, and a polypyrimidine tract, provide evidence for an equilibrium between pseudoknot and hairpin structures. This equilibrium is sensitive to multivalent cations, and can be forced towards the pseudoknot by addition of 5 mM cobalt hexammine. In the two conformations, the splice site and other functional elements exist in very different structural environments. In particular, the splice site is sequestered in the middle of a double helix in the pseudoknot conformation, while in the hairpin it resides in a two-by-two nucleotide internal loop. The results suggest that segment 7 mRNA splicing can be controlled by a conformational switch that exposes or hides the splice site. © 2012 Moss et al.},

Moreover, binding the regulatory hairpin of small molecule ligands (neomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin and mitoxantrone) enhance its stability depending on the nature of the ligands and the RNA mutations. Experiments using the cos-7 cell line indicate that the presence of ligands and modified antisense oligonucleotides affect the quantity of 3R and 4R isoforms. This finding correlates with the thermodynamic stability of the regulatory hairpin.

How do cells coordinate the assembly of this molecular machine? And how does the spliceosome accurately recognize exons and introns to carry out the splicing reaction? Insights into these questions have been gained by studying the life cycle of spliceosomal snRNAs from their transcription, nuclear export and re-import to their dynamic assembly into the spliceosome.

RNA is single-stranded, which gives it the freedom to fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures. These structures endow RNA with the ability to perform complex chemistries and functions ranging from enzymatic activity to gene regulation. Given that RNA is involved in many essential cellular processes, it is critical to understand how it folds and functions in vivo . Within the last few years, methods have been developed to probe RNA structures in vivo and genome-wide. These studies reveal that RNA often adopts very different structures in vivo and in vitro , and provide profound insights into RNA biology. Nonetheless, both in vitro and in vivo approaches have limitations: studies in the complex and uncontrolled cellular environment make it difficult to obtain insight into RNA folding pathways and thermodynamics, and studies in vitro often lack direct cellular relevance, leaving a gap in our knowledge of RNA folding in vivo . This gap is being bridged by biophysical and mechanistic studies of RNA structure and function under conditions that mimic the cellular environment. To date, most artificial cytoplasms have used various polymers as molecular crowding agents and a series of small molecules as cosolutes. Studies under such in vivo-like conditions are yielding fresh insights, such as cooperative folding of functional RNAs and increased activity of ribozymes. These observations are accounted for in part by molecular crowding effects and interactions with other molecules. In this review, we report milestones in RNA folding in vitro and in vivo and discuss ongoing experimental and computational efforts to bridge the gap between these two conditions in order to understand how RNA folds in the cell. },

To define roles for ncRNAs, we have developed a method enabling the global-scale mapping of RNA-RNA duplexes crosslinked in vivo, "LIGation of interacting RNA followed by high-throughput sequencing" (LIGR-seq). Applying this method in human cells reveals a remarkable landscape of RNA-RNA interactions involving all major classes of ncRNA and mRNA.

   abstract = {Motivation
In contrast to messenger RNAs, the function of the wide range of existing long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) largely depends on their structure, which determines interactions with partner molecules. Thus, the determination or prediction of the secondary structure of lncRNAs is critical to uncover their function. Classical approaches for predicting RNA secondary structure have been based on dynamic programming and thermodynamic calculations. In the last 4 years, a growing number of machine learning (ML)-based models, including deep learning (DL), have achieved breakthrough performance in structure prediction of biomolecules such as proteins and have outperformed classical methods in short transcripts folding. Nevertheless, the accurate prediction for lncRNA still remains far from being effectively solved. Notably, the myriad of new proposals has not been systematically and experimentally evaluated.

Results
In this work, we compare the performance of the classical methods as well as the most recently proposed approaches for secondary structure prediction of RNA sequences using a unified and consistent experimental setup. We use the publicly available structural profiles for 3023 yeast RNA sequences, and a novel benchmark of well-characterized lncRNA structures from different species. Moreover, we propose a novel metric to assess the predictive performance of methods, exclusively based on the chemical probing data commonly used for profiling RNA structures, avoiding any potential bias incorporated by computational predictions when using dot-bracket references. Our results provide a comprehensive comparative assessment of existing methodologies, and a novel and public benchmark resource to aid in the development and comparison of future approaches.

In part, this is the consequence of a limited precision of the computational tools in spite of recent exciting progress in this area, and to a certain extent, computational costs are still problematic in practice. An important, and as we argue here, dominating issue is the dependence on good curated (secondary) structural alignments of the RNAs. These are often hard to obtain, not so much because of an inherent limitation in the available data, but because they require substantial manual curation, an effort that is rarely acknowledged. Here, we qualitatively describe a realistic scenario for what a "regular user" (i.e., a nonexpert in a particular RNA family) can do in practice, and what kind of results are likely to be achieved. Despite the indisputable advances in computational RNA biology, the conclusion is discouraging: BLAST still works better or equally good as other methods unless extensive expert knowledge on the RNA family is included. However, when good curated data are available the recent development yields further improvements in finding remote homologs.

   abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) has become a powerful tool for the visualization, probing and manipulation of RNA at the single molecule level. AFM measurements can be carried out in buffer solution in a physiological medium, which is crucial to study the structure and function of biomolecules, also allowing studying them at work. Imaging the specimen in its native state is a great advantage compared to other high resolution methods such as electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. There is no need to stain, freeze or crystallize biological samples. Moreover, compared to NMR spectroscopy for instance, for AFM studies the size of the biomolecules is not limiting. Consequently the AFM allows one also to investigate larger RNA molecules. In particular, structural studies of nucleic acids and assemblies thereof, have been carried out by AFM routinely including ssRNA, dsRNA and nucleoprotein complexes thereof, as well as RNA aggregates and 2D RNA assemblies. These are becoming increasingly important as novel unique building blocks in the emerging field of RNA nanotechnology. In particular by AFM unique information can be obtained on these RNA based assemblies. Moreover, the AFM is of fundamental relevance to study biological relevant RNA interactions and dynamics. In this short review a brief overview will be given on structural studies that have been done related to AFM topographic imaging of RNA, RNA assemblies and aggregates. Finally, an overview on AFM beyond imaging will be provided. This includes force spectroscopy of RNA under physiological conditions in aqueous buffer to probe RNA interaction with proteins and ligands as well as other AFM tip based RNA probing. Important applications include the detection and quantification of RNA in biological samples. A selection of recent highlights and breakthroughs will be provided related to structural and functional studies by AFM. The main intention of this short review to provide the reader with a flavor of what AFM is able to contribute to RNA research and engineering.},

Despite the modern notion that pandemic influenza is a distinct phenomenon obeying such constant (if incompletely understood) rules such as dramatic genetic change, cyclicity, "wave" patterning, virus replacement, and predictable epidemic behavior, much evidence suggests the opposite. Although there is much that we know about pandemic influenza, there appears to be much more that we do not know. Pandemics arise as a result of various genetic mechanisms, have no predictable patterns of mortality among different age groups, and vary greatly in how and when they arise and recur. Some are followed by new pandemics, whereas others fade gradually or abruptly into long-term endemicity. Human influenza pandemics have been caused by viruses that evolved singly or in co-circulation with other pandemic virus descendants and often have involved significant transmission between, or establishment of, viral reservoirs within other animal hosts. In recent decades, pandemic influenza has continued to produce numerous unanticipated events that expose fundamental gaps in scientific knowledge. Influenza pandemics appear to be not a single phenomenon but a heterogeneous collection of viral evolutionary events whose similarities are overshadowed by important differences, the determinants of which remain poorly understood. These uncertainties make it difficult to predict influenza pandemics and, therefore, to adequately plan to prevent them. © 2011.},

In this article, we discuss the pathogenesis of this virus as it relates to RV-induced illness in the upper and lower airway, an issue of considerable interest in view of the minimal cytopathology associated with RV infection. We endeavor to explain why many infected individuals exhibit minimal symptoms or remain asymptomatic, while others, especially those with asthma, may have severe, even life-threatening, complications (sequelae).

Although there have been extensive studies of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic techniques, animal models and the immunobiology of infection, there is not yet a convincing and safe vaccine available. The major histopathologic characteristics of RSV infection are acute bronchiolitis, mucosal and submucosal edema, and luminal occlusion by cellular debris of sloughed epithelial cells mixed with macrophages, strands of fibrin, and some mucin. There is a single RSV serotype with two major antigenic subgroups, A and B. Strains of both subtypes often co-circulate, but usually one subtype predominates. In temperate climates, RSV infections reflect a distinct seasonality with onset in late fall or early winter. It is believed that most children will experience at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years. There are several key animal models of RSV. These include a model in mice and, more importantly, a bovine model; the latter reflects distinct similarity to the human disease. Importantly, the prevalence of asthma is significantly higher amongst children who are hospitalized with RSV in infancy or early childhood. However, there have been only limited investigations of candidate genes that have the potential to explain this increase in susceptibility. An atopic predisposition appears to predispose to subsequent development of asthma and it is likely that subsequent development of asthma is secondary to the pathogenic inflammatory response involving cytokines, chemokines and their cognate receptors. Numerous approaches to the development of RSV vaccines are being evaluated, as are the use of newer antiviral agents to mitigate disease. There is also significant attention being placed on the potential impact of co-infection and defining the natural history of RSV. Clearly, more research is required to define the relationships between RSV bronchiolitis, other viral induced inflammatory responses, and asthma. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Beginning with the 1967 Marburg outbreak, 30 epidemics, isolated cases, and accidental laboratory infections have been described in the medical literature. We reviewed those reports to determine the basic clinical and laboratory features of filoviral HF. The most detailed information was found in descriptions of patients treated in industrialized countries; except for the 2000 outbreak of Ebola Sudan HF in Uganda, reports of epidemics in central Africa provided little controlled or objective clinical data. Other than the case fatality rate, there were no clear differences in the features of the various filovirus infections. This compilation will be of value to medical workers responding to epidemics and to investigators attempting to develop animal models of filoviral HF.

   abstract = {Today, dengue viruses are the most prevalent arthropod-borne viruses in the world. Since the 1960s, numerous reports have identified a second heterologous dengue virus (DENV) infection as a principal risk factor for severe dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, DHF/DSS). Modifiers of dengue disease response include the specific sequence of two DENV infections, the interval between infections, and contributions from the human host, such as age, ethnicity, chronic illnesses and genetic background. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus infection has been proposed as the early mechanism underlying DHF/DSS. Dengue cross-reactive antibodies raised following a first dengue infection combine with a second infecting virus to form infectious immune complexes that enter Fc-receptor-bearing cells. This results in an increased number of infected cells and increased viral output per cell. At the late illness stage, high levels of cytokines, possibly the result of T cell elimination of infected cells, result in vascular permeability, leading to shock and death. This review is focused on the etiological role of secondary infections (SI) and mechanisms of ADE. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.},

   abstract = {The characterization of functional yet nonprotein coding (nc) RNAs has expanded the role of RNA in the cell from a passive player in the central dogma of molecular biology to an active regulator of gene expression. The misregulation of ncRNA function has been linked with a variety of diseases and disorders ranging from cancers to neurodegeneration. However, a detailed molecular understanding of how ncRNAs function has been limited; due, in part, to the difficulties associated with obtaining high-resolution structures of large RNAs. Tertiary structure determination of RNA as a whole is hampered by various technical challenges, all of which are exacerbated as the size of the RNA increases. Namely, RNAs tend to be highly flexible and dynamic molecules, which are difficult to crystallize. Biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers a viable alternative to determining the structure of large RNA molecules that do not readily crystallize, but is itself hindered by some technical limitations. Recently, a series of advancements have allowed the biomolecular NMR field to overcome, at least in part, some of these limitations. These advances include improvements in sample preparation strategies as well as methodological improvements. Together, these innovations pave the way for the study of ever larger RNA molecules that have important biological function.

The frameshift event is induced by two highly conserved RNA elements within the HIV-1 mRNA: a UUUUUUA heptamer known as the slippery sequence, and a downstream RNA structure. Here, we report structural and thermodynamic evidence that the HIV-1 frameshift site RNA forms a stem-loop and lower helix separated by a three-purine bulge. We have determined the structure of the 45 nucleotide frameshift site RNA using multidimensional heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. The upper helix is highly thermostable (Tm>90°C), forming 11 Watson-Crick base-pairs capped by a stable ACAA tetraloop. The eight base-pair lower helix was found to be only moderately stable (Tm=47°C). A three-purine bulge separates the highly stable upper helix from the lower helix. Base stacking in the bulge forms a wedge, introducing a 60°bend between the helices. Interestingly, this bend is similar to those seen in a number of frameshift inducing pseudoknots for which structures have been solved. The lower helix must denature to allow the ribosome access to the slippery site, but likely functions as a positioning element that enhances frameshift efficiency. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Collectively, this work has led to a detailed understanding of viral replication and the development of 24 approved drugs that have five different targets on various viral proteins and one cellular target (CCR5). Although most drugs target viral enzymatic activities, our detailed knowledge of so much of the viral life cycle is leading us into other types of inhibitors that can block or disrupt proteinprotein interactions. Viruses have compact genomes and employ a strategy of using a small number of proteins that can form repeating structures to enclose space (i.e. condensing the viral genome inside of a protein shell), thus minimizing the need for a large protein coding capacity. This creates a relatively small number of critical protein-protein interactions that are essential for viral replication. For HIV-1, the Gag protein has the role of a polyprotein precursor that contains all of the structural proteins of the virion: matrix, capsid, spacer peptide 1, nucleocapsid, spacer peptide 2, and p6 (which contains protein-binding domains that interact with host proteins during budding). Similarly, the Gag-Pro-Pol precursor encodes most of the Gag protein but now includes the viral enzymes: protease, reverse transcriptase (with its associated RNase H activity), and integrase. Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol are the substrates of the viral protease, which is responsible for cleaving these precursors into their mature and fully active forms (see Fig. 1A). © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus (CoV) transcription requires a high-frequency recombination process that links newly synthesized minus-strand subgenomic RNA copies to the leader region, which is present only once, at the 5' end of the genome. This discontinuous RNA synthesis step is based on the complementarity between the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) at the leader region and those preceding each gene in the nascent minus-strand RNA. Furthermore, the template switch requires the physical proximity of RNA genome domains located between 20,000 and 30,000 nucleotides apart. In this report, it is shown that the efficacy of this recombination step is promoted by novel additional long-distance RNA-RNA interactions between RNA motifs located close to the TRSs controlling the expression of each gene and their complementary sequences mapping close to the 5' end of the genome. These interactions would bring together the motifs involved in the recombination process. This finding indicates that the formation of high-order RNA structures in the CoV genome is necessary to control the expression of at least the viral N gene. The requirement of these long-distance interactions for transcription was shown by the engineering of CoV replicons in which the complementarity between the newly identified sequences was disrupted. Furthermore, disruption of complementarity in mutant viruses led to mutations that restored complementarity, wild-type transcription levels, and viral titers by passage in cell cultures. The relevance of these high-order structures for virus transcription is reinforced by the phylogenetic conservation of the involved RNA motifs in CoVs.},

Using vRIC-seq data, we reconstruct the tertiary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and reveal a surprisingly “unentangled globule” conformation. We uncover many long-range duplexes and higher-order junctions, both of which are under purifying selections and contribute to the sequential package of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Unexpectedly, the D614G and the other two accompanying mutations may remodel duplexes into more stable forms. Lastly, the structure-guided design of potent small interfering RNAs can obliterate the SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells.

Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

   abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) translation is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located at the 5' end of the genomic RNA. The 3' untranslatable region (3'UTR) stimulates translation by the recruitment of protein factors that simultaneously bind to the 5' end of the viral genome. This leads to the formation of a macromolecular complex with a closed loop conformation, similar to that described for the cap-translated mRNAs. We previously demonstrated the existence of a long-range RNA-RNA interaction involving subdomain IIId of the IRES region and the stem-loop 5BSL3.2 of the CRE element at the 3' end of the viral genome. The present study provides evidence that the enhancement of HCV IRES-dependent translation mediated by the 3'UTR is negatively controlled by the CRE region in the human hepatoma cell lines Huh-7 and Hep-G2 in a time-dependent manner. Domain 5BSL3.2 is the major partner in this process. Mutations in this motif lead to an increase in IRES activity by up to eightfold. These data support the existence of a functional high order structure in the HCV genome that involves two evolutionarily conserved RNA elements, domain IIId in the IRES and stem-loop 5BSL3.2 in the CRE region. This interaction could have a role in the circularisation of the viral genome. © 2011 Springer Basel AG.},

Through a combination of improved RNA chemical probing methods, SHAPE structural analysis and screening of RNA accessibility using antisense oligonucleotide microarrays, here, we show that HCV IRES folding is fine-tuned by the genomic 3'-end. The essential IRES subdomains IIIb and IIId, and domain IV, adopted a different conformation in the presence of the cis-acting replication element and/or the 3'-untranslatable region compared to that taken up in their absence. Importantly, many of the observed changes involved significant decreases in the dimethyl sulfate or N-methyl-isatoic anhydride reactivity profiles at subdomains IIIb and IIId, while domain IV appeared as a more flexible element. These observations were additionally confirmed in a replication-competent RNA molecule. Significantly, protein factors are not required for these conformational differences to be made manifest. Our results suggest that a complex, direct and long-distance RNA-RNA interaction network plays an important role in the regulation of HCV translation and replication, as well as in the switching between different steps of the viral cycle. © 2012 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The RNA genome of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) contains multiple conserved structural cis domains that direct protein synthesis, replication, and infectivity. The untranslatable regions (UTRs) play essential roles in the HCV cycle. Uncapped viral RNAs are translated via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located at the 5' UTR, which acts as a scaffold for recruiting multiple protein factors. Replication of the viral genome is initiated at the 3' UTR. Bioinformatics methods have identified other structural RNA elements thought to be involved in the HCV cycle. The 5BSL3.2 motif, which is embedded in a cruciform structure at the 3' end of the NS5B coding sequence, contributes to the three-dimensional folding of the entire 3' end of the genome. It is essential in the initiation of replication. This paper reports the identification of a novel, strand-specific, long-range RNA-RNA interaction between the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, which involves 5BSL3.2 and IRES motifs. Mutants harboring substitutions in the apical loop of domain IIId or in the internal loop of 5BSL3.2 disrupt the complex, indicating these regions are essential in initiating the kissing interaction. No complex was formed when the UTRs of the related foot and mouth disease virus were used in binding assays, suggesting this interaction is specific for HCV sequences. The present data firmly suggest the existence of a higher-order structure that may mediate a protein-independent circularization of the HCV genome. The 5'-3' end bridge may have a role in viral translation modulation and in the switch from protein synthesis to RNA replication. Copyright © 2009 RNA Society.},

Encapsidating two copies of genomic RNA is one of the characteristics of the retrovirus family. The two RNA molecules are both positive-sense and often identical; furthermore, each RNA encodes the full complement of genetic information required for viral replication. The two strands of RNA are intricately entwined within the core of the mature infectious virus as a ribonuclear complex with the viral proteins, including nucleocapsid. Multiple steps in the biogenesis of the genomic full-length RNA are involved in achieving this location and dimeric state. The viral sequences and proteins involved in the process of RNA dimerization, both for the initial interstrand contact and subsequent steps that result in the condensed, stable conformation of the genomic RNA, are outlined in this review. In addition, the impact of the dimeric state of HIV-1 viral RNA is discussed with respect to its importance in efficient viral replication and, consequently, the potential development of antiviral strategies designed to disrupt the formation of dimeric RNA.},

The first strand transfer involves a jump from the 5' to the 3' terminal repeat (R) region positioned at each end of the viral genome. The process depends on base pairing between the cDNA synthesized from the 5' R region and the 3' R RNA. The tertiary conformation of the viral RNA genome may facilitate strand transfer by juxtaposing the 5' R and 3' R sequences that are 9 kb apart in the linear sequence. In this study, RNA sequences involved in an interaction between the 5' and 3' ends of the HIV-1 genome were mapped by mutational analysis. This interaction appears to be mediated mainly by a sequence in the extreme 3' end of the viral genome and in the gag open reading frame. Mutation of 3' R sequences was found to inhibit the 5'-3' interaction, which could be restored by a complementary mutation in the 5' gag region. Furthermore, we find that circularization of the HIV-1 genome does not affect the initiation of reverse transcription, but stimulates the first strand transfer during reverse transcription in vitro, underscoring the functional importance of the interaction.

Herein, we show that SL1 is functionally and structurally bipartite. While the upper region of SL1 is required to be paired, we observe strong genetic selection against viruses that contain a deletion of A35, an extrahelical nucleotide that destabilizes SL1, in favor of genomes that contain a diverse panel of destabilizing second-site mutations, due to introduction of a noncanonical base pair near A35. Viruses containing destabilizing SL1-ΔA35 mutations also contain one of two specific mutations in the 3' UTR. Thermal denaturation and imino proton solvent exchange experiments reveal that the lower half of SL1 is unstable and that second-site SL1-ΔA35 substitutions are characterized by one or more features of the wild-type SL1. We propose a "dynamic SL1" model, in which the base of SL1 has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the 5' UTR and the 3' UTR that stimulates subgenomic RNA synthesis. Although not conserved at the nucleotide sequence level, these general structural characteristics of SL1 appear to be conserved in other coronaviral genomes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) between (Cy5)EF-G and (Cy3)tRNALys,we studied the translational elongation dynamics of -1PRF in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene, which contains three frameshifting signals: a slippery sequence (A AAA AAG), a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and a downstream hairpin. The frameshift promoting signals mostly impair the EF-G-catalyzed translocation step of the two tRNALys and the slippery codons from the A- and P- sites. The hairpin acts as a road block slowing the translocation rate. The upstream SD sequence together with the hairpin promotes dissociation of futile EF-G and thus causes multiple EF-G driven translocation attempts. A slippery sequence also helps dissociation of the EF-G by providing alternative base-pairing options. These results indicate that frameshifting takes place during the repetitive ribosomal conformational changes associated with EF-G dissociation upon unsuccessful translocation attempts of the second slippage codon from the A- to the P- sites.},

Classes of signals have been identified that direct a fraction of elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by one base in the 5' (-1) or 3' (+1) direction. This is called programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). Although mechanisms of PRF differ, a common feature is induction of ribosome pausing, which alters kinetic partitioning rates between in-frame and out-of-frame codons at specific 'slippery' sequences. Many viruses use PRF to ensure synthesis of the correct ratios of virus-encoded proteins required for proper viral particle assembly and maturation, thus identifying PRF as an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. In contrast, recent studies indicate that PRF signals may primarily function as mRNA destabilizing elements in cellular mRNAs. These studies suggest that PRF may be used to fine-tune gene expression through mRNA decay pathways. The possible regulation of PRF by noncoding RNAs is also discussed. © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Treatment of HIV-1 has largely involved targeting viral enzymes using a cocktail of inhibitors. However, resistance to these inhibitors and toxicity in the long term have pushed the field to identify new therapeutic targets. To that end, -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) has gained attention as a potential node for therapeutic intervention. In this process, a ribosome moves one nucleotide backward in the course of translating a mRNA, revealing a new reading frame for protein synthesis. In HIV-1, -1 PRF allows the virus to regulate the ratios of enzymatic and structural proteins as needed for correct viral particle assembly. Two RNA structural elements are central to -1 PRF in HIV: a slippery sequence and a highly conserved stable hairpin called the HIV-1 frameshifting stimulatory signal (FSS). Dysregulation of -1 PRF is deleterious for the virus. Thus, -1 PRF is an attractive target for new antiviral development. It is important to note that HIV-1 is not the only virus exploiting -1 PRF for regulating production of its proteins. Coronaviruses, including the COVID-19 pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, also rely on -1 PRF. In SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, -1 PRF is required for synthesis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and several other nonstructural proteins. Coronaviruses employ a more complex RNA structural element for regulating -1 PRF called a pseudoknot.
The purpose of this Account is primarily to review the development of molecules targeting HIV-1 -1 PRF. These approaches are case studies illustrating how the entire pipeline from screening to the generation of high-affinity leads might be implemented. We consider both target-based and function-based screening, with a particular focus on our group’s approach beginning with a resin-bound dynamic combinatorial library (RBDCL) screen. We then used rational design approaches to optimize binding affinity, selectivity, and cellular bioavailability. Our tactic is, to the best of our knowledge, the only study resulting in compounds that bind specifically to the HIV-1 FSS RNA and reduce infectivity of laboratory and drug-resistant strains of HIV-1 in human cells. Lessons learned from strategies targeting -1 PRF HIV-1 might provide solutions in the development of antivirals in areas of unmet medical need. This includes the development of new frameshift-altering therapies for SARS-CoV-2, approaches to which are very recently beginning to appear.},

   abstract = {The genomic RNA of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus contains an efficient ribosomal frameshift signal which comprises a heptanucleotide slippery sequence followed by an RNA pseudoknot structure. The presence of the pseudoknot is essential for high-efficiency frameshifting, and it has been suggested that its function may be to slow or stall the ribosome in the vicinity of the slippery sequence. To test this possibility, we have studied translational elongation in vitro on mRNAs engineered to contain a well-defined pseudoknot-forming sequence. Insertion of the pseudoknot at a specific location within the influenza virus PB1 mRNA resulted in the production of a new translational intermediate corresponding to the size expected for ribosomal arrest at the pseudoknot. The appearance of this protein was transient, indicating that it was a true paused intermediate rather than a dead-end product, and mutational analysis confirmed that its appearance was dependent on the presence of a pseudoknot structure within the mRNA. These observations raise the possibility that a pause is required for the frameshift process. The extent of pausing at the pseudoknot was compared with that observed at a sequence designed to form a simple stem-loop structure with the same base pairs as the pseudoknot. This structure proved to be a less effective barrier to the elongating ribosome than the pseudoknot and in addition was unable to direct efficient ribosomal frameshifting, as would be expected if pausing plays an important role in frameshifting. However, the stem-loop was still able to induce significant pausing, and so this effect alone may be insufficient to account for the contribution of the pseudoknot to frameshifting.},

A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and frameshifting efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind frameshifting still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknot-like structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited frameshifting. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were frameshifted but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the frameshifted ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the frameshifting efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length frameshifted product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced. Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a prerequisite for formulating correct frameshifting hypotheses. © 2011 The Author(s).},

Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this virus, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in cells infected with both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intraspecies variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms being associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. The numerous cellular genes and gene networks found to be differentially expressed during virus infection provide insights into the host cell response to IBV infection.Like all coronaviruses, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) possesses a long, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (∼27 kb) and has a complex replication strategy that includes the production of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs). Here, we used whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-R strains at subcodon resolution. RNASeq facilitated a comparative analysis of viral RNA synthesis and revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-R strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied open reading frame (dORF) located downstream of the nucleocapsid coding region. RiboSeq permitted quantification of the translational efficiency of virus gene expression and identified, for the first time, sites of ribosomal pausing on the genome. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33 to 40\%). Triplet phasing of RiboSeq data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two ORFs (ORF4b and ORF4c on sgmRNA IR), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. Analysis of differential gene expression in infected primary chick kidney cells indicated that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with global upregulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes. Cellular genes and gene networks differentially expressed during virus infection were also identified, giving insights into the host cell response to IBV infection. IMPORTANCE IBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this virus, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in cells infected with both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intraspecies variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms being associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. The numerous cellular genes and gene networks found to be differentially expressed during virus infection provide insights into the host cell response to IBV infection. },

   abstract = {Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is often used by viral pathogens including HIV. Slippery sequences present in some mRNAs cause the ribosome to shift reading frame. The resulting protein is thus encoded by one reading frame upstream from the slippery sequence and by another reading frame downstream from the slippery sequence. Although the mechanism is not well understood, frameshifting is known to be stimulated by an mRNA structure such as a pseudoknot. Here, we show that the efficiency of frameshifting relates to the mechanical strength of the pseudoknot. Two pseudoknots derived from the Infectious Bronchitis Virus were used, differing by one base pair in the first stem. In Escherichia coli, these two pseudoknots caused frameshifting frequencies that differed by a factor of two. We used optical tweezers to unfold the pseudoknots. The pseudoknot giving rise to the highest degree of frameshifting required a nearly 2-fold larger unfolding force than the other. The observed energy difference cannot be accounted for by any existing model. We propose that the degree of ribosomal frameshifting is related to the mechanical strength of RNA pseudoknots. Our observations support the "9 Å model" that predicts some physical barrier is needed to force the ribosome into the -1 frame. Also, our findings support the recent observation made by cryoelectron microscopy that mechanical interaction between a ribosome and a pseudoknot causes a deformation of the A-site tRNA. The result has implications for the understanding of genetic regulation, reading frame maintenance, tRNA movement, and unwinding of mRNA secondary structures by ribosomes. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

In the presence of mRNA secondary structures, a heptanucleotide 'slippery sequence'usually defined by the motif X XXY YYZ, and (in some prokaryotic cases) mRNA sequences that base pair with the 3â €2 end of the 16S ribosomal rRNA (internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences), there is an increased probability that a specific programmed change of frame occurs, wherein the ribosome shifts one nucleotide backwards into an overlapping reading frame (-1 frame) and continues by translating a new sequence of amino acids2,3. Despite extensive biochemical and genetic studies, there is no clear mechanistic description for frameshifting. Here we apply single-molecule fluorescence to track the compositional and conformational dynamics of individual ribosomes at each codon during translation of a frameshift-inducing mRNA from the dnaX gene in Escherichia coli. Ribosomes that frameshift into the -1 frame are characterized by a tenfold longer pause in elongation compared to non-frameshifted ribosomes, which translate through unperturbed. During the pause, interactions of the ribosome with the mRNA stimulatory elements uncouple EF-G catalysed translocation from normal ribosomal subunit reverse-rotation, leaving the ribosome in a non-canonical intersubunit rotated state with an exposed codon in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). tRNA Lys sampling and accommodation to the empty A site and EF-G action either leads to the slippage of the tRNAs into the -1 frame or maintains the ribosome into the 0 frame. Our results provide a general mechanistic and conformational framework for -1 frameshifting, highlighting multiple kinetic branchpoints during elongation. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The HIV frameshift site consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) followed by a spacer region and a downstream RNA stem-loop structure. Here we investigate the role of the RNA structure in promoting the -1 frameshift. The stem-loop was systematically altered to decouple the contributions of local and overall thermodynamic stability towards frameshift efficiency. No correlation between overall stability and frameshift efficiency is observed. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between frameshift efficiency and the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3-4 bp in the stem-loop, which are predicted to reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance channel when the ribosome is paused at the slippery site. Insertion or deletions in the spacer region appear to correspondingly change the identity of the base pairs encountered 8 nt downstream of the slippery site. Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation. © 2012 The Author(s) 2012.

However, understanding RNA dimerization has been hampered by the lack of systematic in vivo detection methods. Here, we show that CLASH, PARIS, and other RNA proximity ligation methods detect RNA homodimers transcriptome-wide as "overlapping" chimeric reads that contain more than one copy of the same sequence. Analyzing published proximity ligation data sets, we show that RNA:RNA homodimers mediated by direct base-pairing are rare across the human transcriptome, but highly enriched in specific transcripts, including U8 snoRNA, U2 snRNA, and a subset of tRNAs. Mutations in the homodimerization domain of U8 snoRNA impede dimerization in vitro and disrupt zebrafish development in vivo, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role of this domain. Analysis of virus-infected cells reveals homodimerization of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika genomes, mediated by specific palindromic sequences located within protein-coding regions of N gene in SARS-CoV-2 and NS2A gene in Zika. We speculate that regions of viral genomes involved in homodimerization may constitute effective targets for antiviral therapies.},

A PSL2-targeting locked nucleic acid (LNA), administered 3 d after, or 14 d before, a lethal IAV inoculum provided 100\% survival in mice, led to the development of strong immunity to rechallenge with a tenfold lethal inoculum, evaded attempts to select for resistance and retained full potency against neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant virus.

Rapid deployment of non-invasive therapeutic avenues capable of preventing infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variants could complement current vaccination efforts and help turn the tide on the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs). We identify an LNA ASO binding to the 5' leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that disrupts a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy in preventing viral replication in human cells. Daily intranasal administration of this LNA ASO in the COVID-19 mouse model potently suppresses viral replication (\&gt;80-fold) in the lungs of infected mice. We find that the LNA ASO is efficacious in countering all SARS-CoV-2 “variants of concern” tested both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising therapeutic approach to reduce or prevent transmission and decrease severity of COVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically stable and can be flexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences and could be stockpiled for future coronavirus pandemics.</p>},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that evades antiviral immunity by interfering with host protein synthesis, mRNA stability, and protein trafficking. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) uses its C-terminal domain to block the messenger RNA (mRNA) entry channel of the 40S ribosome to inhibit host protein synthesis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents Nsp1-mediated suppression for viral protein synthesis and if the mechanism can be targeted therapeutically remain unclear. Here, we show that N- and C-terminal domains of Nsp1 coordinate to drive a tuned ratio of viral to host translation, likely to maintain a certain level of host fitness while maximizing replication. We reveal that the stem-loop 1 (SL1) region of the SARS-CoV-2 50 untranslated region (50 UTR) is necessary and sufficient to evade Nsp1-mediated translational suppression. Targeting SL1 with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides inhibits viral translation and makes SARS-CoV-2 50 UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 suppression, hindering viral replication in vitro at a nanomolar concentration, as well as providing protection against SARS-CoV-2–induced lethality in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2. Thus, SL1 allows Nsp1 to switch infected cells from host to SARS-CoV-2 translation, presenting a therapeutic target against COVID-19 that is conserved among immune-evasive variants. This unique strategy of unleashing a virus’ own virulence mechanism against itself could force a critical trade-off between drug resistance and pathogenicity.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into nonstructural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. Despite the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds, however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1 and we show that the evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5'UTR of SARS-CoV-2. Only the apical part of SL1 is required for viral translation. We further show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation and fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation in the presence of the SL1 5'UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of subgenomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine "Achilles heel"of the virus.},

Structural analysis by cryo - electron microscopy of in vitro - reconstituted Nsp1-40S and various native Nsp1-40S and -80S complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel.

The propagation of nsp1 mutant virus is inhibited exclusively in cells with intact interferon (IFN) pathway as well as in vivo, in hamsters, and this attenuation is associated with stronger induction of type I IFN response. Therefore, although nsp1’s shutoff activity is broad, it plays an essential role, specifically in counteracting the IFN response.

Here we combine RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and metabolic labelling of newly synthesized RNA to comprehensively define the mechanisms that are used by SARS-CoV-2 to shut off cellular protein synthesis. We show that infection leads to a global reduction in translation, but that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we find that infection leads to the accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs, which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. We reveal that the translation of transcripts that are induced in response to infection (including innate immune genes) is impaired. We demonstrate this impairment is probably mediated by inhibition of nuclear mRNA export, which prevents newly transcribed cellular mRNA from accessing ribosomes.

Although the sequences and overall structures of the RNA pseudoknots from PLRV and beet western yellow virus (BWYV) are similar, nucleotide deletions in the linker and adjacent minor groove loop abolish frameshifting only with the latter. Conversely, mutant PLRV pseudoknots with up to four nucleotides deleted in this region exhibit nearly wild-type frameshifting efficiencies. The crystal structure helps rationalize the different tolerances for deletions in the PLRV and BWYV RNAs, and we have used it to build a three-dimensional model of the PRLV pseudoknot with a four-nucleotide deletion. The resulting structure defines a minimal RNA pseudoknot motif composed of 22 nucleotides capable of stimulating -1-type ribosomal frameshifts. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) encodes a 28-nt mRNA pseudoknot that promotes -1 PRF between the P1 (protease) and P2 (polymerase) genes in plant luteoviruses. The solution structure of the ScYLV pseudoknot reveals a well ordered loop 2 (L2) that exhibits continuous stacking of A20 through C27 in the minor groove of the upper stem 1 (S1), with C25 flipped out of the triple-stranded stack. Five consecutive triple base pairs flank the helical junction where the 3' nucleotide of L2, C27, adopts a cytidine 27 N3-cytidine 14 2'-OH hydrogen bonding interaction with the C14-G7 base pair. This interaction is isosteric with the adenosine N1-2'-OH interaction in the related mRNA from beet western yellows virus (BWYV); however, the ScYLV and BWYV mRNA structures differ in their detailed L2-S1 hydrogen bonding and L2 stacking interactions. Functional analyses of ScYLV/BWYV chimeric pseudoknots reveal that the ScYLV RNA stimulates a higher level of -1 PRF (15 ± 2\%) relative to the BWYV pseudoknot (6 ± 1\%), a difference traced largely to the identity of the 3' nucleotide of L2 (C27 vs. A25 in BWYV). Strikingly, C27A ScYLV RNA is a poor frameshift stimulator (2.0\%) and is destabilized by ≈1.5 kcal·mol-1 (pH 7.0, 37°C) with respect to the wild-type pseudoknot. These studies establish that the precise network of weak interactions nearest the helical junction in structurally similar pseudoknots make an important contribution to setting the frameshift efficiency in mRNAs. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Here, we apply single-molecule and ensemble approaches to formulate a mechanistic model of ribosomal -1 frameshifting. Our model suggests that the ribosome is intrinsically susceptible to frameshift before its translocation and this transient state is prolonged by the presence of a precisely positioned downstream mRNA structure. We challenged this model using temperature variation in vivo, which followed the prediction made based on in vitro results. Our results provide a quantitative framework for analyzing other frameshifting enhancers and a potential approach to control gene expression dynamically using programmed frameshifting.},

Translation of the pol gene is dependent upon readthrough of the gag UAG stop codon; whereas the env gene is translated from spliced mRNA transcripts. Here, we report the first high resolution analysis of retrovirus gene expression through tandem ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of MuLV-infected cells. Results: Ribosome profiling of MuLV-infected cells was performed, using the translational inhibitors harringtonine and cycloheximide to distinguish initiating and elongating ribosomes, respectively. Meta-analyses of host cell gene expression demonstrated that the RiboSeq datasets specifically captured the footprints of translating ribosomes at high resolution. Direct measurement of ribosomal occupancy of the MuLV genomic RNA indicated that~7\% of ribosomes undergo gag stop codon readthrough to access the pol gene. Initiation of translation was found to occur at several additional sites within the 5' leaders of the gag and env transcripts, upstream of their respective annotated start codons. Conclusions: These experiments reveal the existence of a number of previously uncharacterised, ribosomally occupied open reading frames within the MuLV genome, with possible regulatory consequences. In addition, we provide the first direct measurements of stop codon readthrough efficiency during cellular infection.},

HIV-1 promoted frameshifting was also compared between Escherichia coli and a human T-cell line expression systems. The results of these analyses highlight different aspects of each system, suggesting in general that (1) differences can be due to the assay systems themselves; (2) phylogenetic differences in ribosome structure can affect frameshifting efficiency; and (3) care must be taken to employ the closest phylogenetic match between a specific -1 PRF signal and the choice of translational assay system.

We have examined whether the proposed BWYV signal functions in frameshifting in three translational systems, i.c. In vitro in a reticulocyte lysate or a wheat germ extract and in vivo in E.coli. The efficiency of the signal in the eukaryotic system is low but significant, as it responds strongly to changes in either the slip sequence or the pseudoknot. In contrast, in E.coli there is hardly any response to the same changes. Replacing the slip sequence to the typical prokaryotlc signal AAAAAAG yields more than 5\% frameshift in E.coli. In this organism the frameshifting is highly sensitive to changes in the sup sequence but only slightly to disruption of the pseudoknot. The eukaryotic assay systems are barely sensitive to changes in either AAAAAAG or in the pseudoknot structure in this construct. We conclude that eukaryotic frameshift signals are not recognized by prokaryotes. On the other hand the typical prokaryotic slip sequence AAAAAAG does not lead to significant frameshifting in the eukaryote. In contrast to recent reports on the closely related potato ieafroll virus (PLRV) we show that the frameshifting in BWYV is pseudoknot-dependent. © 1993 Oxford University Press.},

The exact frameshifting route depends on the availability of aminoacyl-tRNAs: the ribosome normally slips into the –1-frame during tRNA translocation, but can also frameshift during decoding at condition when aminoacyl-tRNA is in limited supply. Different frameshifting routes and additional slippery sites allow viruses to maintain a constant production of their key proteins. The emerging idea that tRNA pools are important for frameshifting provides new direction for developing antiviral therapies.},

In this Perspective, we examine the processes that generate these forces, the mechanisms of transmission along the ribosomal exit tunnel to the peptidyl transferase center, and the effects of force on the ribosome's catalytic cycle.

This utilized frameshifting provides a unique tool for studying reading frame control. Peptidyl-tRNA slippage has been invoked to explain many cases of programmed frameshifting. The present work extends this to other cases. When the A-site is unoccupied, the P-site tRNA can be repositioned forward with respect to mRNA (although repositioning in the minus direction is also possible). A kinetic model is presented for the influence of both, the cognate tRNAs competing for overlapping codons in A-site, and the stabilities of P-site tRNA:mRNA complexes in the initial and new frames. When the A-site is occupied, the P-site tRNA can be repositioned backward. Whether frameshifting will happen depends on the ability of the A-site tRNA to subsequently be repositioned to maintain physical proximity of the tRNAs. This model offers an alternative explanation to previously published mechanisms of programmed frameshifting, such as out-of-frame tRNA binding, and a different perspective on simultaneous tandem tRNA slippage.},

They have polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genomes and belong to the order Nidovirales, a diverse group of viruses for which common ancestry was inferred from the common principles underlying their genome organization and expression, and from the conservation of an array of core replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronavirus genomes (~ 26–32 kilobases) are the largest RNA genomes known to date and their expansion was likely enabled by acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. The primary functions that direct coronavirus RNA synthesis and processing reside in nonstructural protein (nsp) 7 to nsp16, which are cleavage products of two large replicase polyproteins translated from the coronavirus genome. Significant progress has now been made regarding their structural and functional characterization, stimulated by technical advances like improved methods for bioinformatics and structural biology, in vitro enzyme characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis of coronavirus genomes. Coronavirus replicase functions include more or less universal activities of plus-stranded RNA viruses, like an RNA polymerase (nsp12) and helicase (nsp13), but also a number of rare or even unique domains involved in mRNA capping (nsp14, nsp16) and fidelity control (nsp14). Several smaller subunits (nsp7–nsp10) act as crucial cofactors of these enzymes and contribute to the emerging “nsp interactome.” Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of coronaviruses will be key to rationalizing their evolutionary success and the development of improved control strategies.},

   abstract = {Motivation: The function of an RNA molecule is not only linked to its native structure, which is usually taken to be the ground state of its folding landscape, but also in many cases crucially depends on the details of the folding pathways such as stable folding intermediates or the timing of the folding process itself. To model and understand these processes, it is necessary to go beyond ground state structures. The study of rugged RNA folding landscapes holds the key to answer these questions. Efficient coarse-graining methods are required to reduce the intractably vast energy landscapes into condensed representations such as barrier trees or basin hopping graphs (BHG) that convey an approximate but comprehensive picture of the folding kinetics. So far, exact and heuristic coarse-graining methods have been mostly restricted to the pseudoknot-free secondary structures. Pseudoknots, which are common motifs and have been repeatedly hypothesized to play an important role in guiding folding trajectories, were usually excluded. Results: We generalize the BHG framework to include pseudoknotted RNA structures and systematically study the differences in predicted folding behavior depending on whether pseudoknotted structures are allowed to occur as folding intermediates or not. We observe that RNAs with pseudoknotted ground state structures tend to have more pseudoknotted folding intermediates than RNAs with pseudoknot-free ground state structures. The occurrence and influence of pseudoknotted intermediates on the folding pathway, however, appear to depend very strongly on the individual RNAs so that no general rule can be inferred.

Because low levels of the gag-pol precursor are naturally produced in HIV-1-infected cells, a limited amount of information is available on the biology of this molecule. To further study this polyprotein, two mutant HIV-1 proviral genomes were created to position the gag and pol genes in the same translational reading frame. The mutations inserted a single thymidine nucleotide at the site of ribosomal frameshifting (nucleotide 1635), which results in the addition of a phenylalanine residue (frameshift 1 [FS1]), or a single adenine nucleotide, which results in the addition of a leucine residue (frameshift 2 [FS2]). Transfection of the mutant proviral genomes into COS-1 cells resulted in the expression of the p160gag-pol polyprotein precursor as well as the proteolytically processed gag and pol gene products. Metabolic labeling of the transfected cells with [3H]myristic acid revealed that the p160gag-pol and p17gag proteins expressed from the mutant genomes were myristylated. While the supernatants from COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant proviral genomes contained similar amounts of p24 antigen, the levels of reverse transcriptase were, on the average, 10 times greater in the supernatants from cells transfected with the FS1 and FS2 proviral genomes. The cells transfected with the wild-type proviral genome released infectious viral particles, while the mutant proviral genomes released p24 and reverse transcriptase in the absence of detectable particle formation. The mutant proviral genomes were completely noninfectious as determined by coculture of the transfected COS-1 cells with SupT1 cells.

There is interest in determining the extent to which frameshifting efficiency can be modulated before virus replication is compromised, and we have addressed this question using the alpharetrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) as a model system. In RSV, frameshifting is essential in the production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein from the overlapping gag and pol coding sequences. The frameshift signal is composed of two elements, a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and, just downstream, a stimulatory RNA structure that has been proposed to be an RNA pseudoknot. Point mutations were introduced into the frameshift signal of an infectious RSV clone, and virus replication was monitored following transfection and subsequent infection of susceptible cells. The introduced mutations were designed to generate a range of frameshifting efficiencies, yet with minimal impact on encoded amino acids. Our results reveal that point mutations leading to a 3-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency noticeably reduce virus replication and that further reduction is severely inhibitory. In contrast, a 3-fold stimulation of frameshifting is well tolerated. These observations suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of frameshifting are likely to have potential as agents for antiviral intervention. During the course of this work, we were able to confirm, for the first time in vivo , that the RSV stimulatory RNA is indeed an RNA pseudoknot but that the pseudoknot per se is not absolutely required for virus viability. },

The consequences of altering the ratios of the Gag and Pol proteins were tested using vaccinia virus expression vectors, in which the gag and pol genes were fused by placing them in the same open reading frame. Immunoblotting of cell lysates indicated that a protein of approximately 160 kDa, the expected translation product of the fused gag-pol gene, was the dominant species detected with HIV-specific antiserum during the first several hours of infection with this recombinant virus. Subsequently, the full-length polyprotein diminished in amount and a series of Gag-related intermediate size proteins appeared. Later in infection, p24 and myristoylated p17 Gag proteins predominated and larger amounts of intracellularly processed reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease were detected compared to the amounts formed with the wild-type gag-pol gene. Large numbers of budding, immature, and mature retrovirus-like particles were visualized by electron microscopy when the wild-type gag-pol gene was expressed, whereas no particles were detected in cells that expressed the fused gag-pol gene. The block to virus assembly was partially overcome by (i) inhibition of the HIV-1 protease with a peptidomimetic inhibitor, (ii) mutagenesis of the active site of the protease, or (iii) shortening of the Gag-Pol polyprotein by deletion of most of the reverse transcriptase gene. Nevertheless, budding was inefficient and the structures appeared immature and frequently aberrant. These results indicated that overproduction of the full-length Gag-Pol polyprotein and increased intracellular protease activity were both detrimental to viral assembly. Further experiments indicated that intracellular processing of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins occurred in the absence of particle formation when myristoylation was prevented. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.},

To assess these hypotheses in the viral context, a series of recombinant HX10-based provirus constructs has been established with clustered amino acid substitutions throughout the entire p6* coding sequence. Comparative analysis of the mutant proviral clones in different cell culture systems revealed that mutations within the well-conserved amino-terminal p6* region modified the Gag/Gag-Pol ratio and thus resulted in the release of viruses with impaired infectivity. Clustered amino acid substitutions destroying (i) the predicted cryptic PR cleavage sites or (ii) homologies to the pepsinogen propeptide did not influence viral replication in cell culture, whereas substitutions of the carboxyl-terminal p6* residues 62 to 68 altering proper release of the mature PR from the Gag-Pol precursor drastically reduced viral infectivity. Thus, the critical contribution of p6* and overlapping cis-acting sequence elements to timely regulated virus maturation and infectivity is closely linked to precise ribosomal frameshifting and proper N-terminal release of the viral PR from the Gag-Pol precursor, clearly disproving the hypothesis that sequence motifs in the central part of p6* modulate PR activation and viral infectivity. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The slippery sequence of HTLV-2 is sufficient to dictate a basal level of frameshifting.

Frameshifting in human immunodeficiency virus gag-pol is similar to that of HTLV-2 gag-pro.

   abstract = {Synthesis the Gag-Pol protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting when ribosomes translate the unspliced viral messenger RNA. This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence followed by an RNA structure motif that stimulates frameshifting. This motif is commonly assumed to be a simple stem-loop for HIV-1. In this study, we show that the frameshift stimulatory signal is more complex than believed and consists of a two-stem helix. The upper stem-loop corresponds to the classic stem-loop, and the lower stem is formed by pairing the spacer region following the slippery sequence and preceding this classic stem-loop with a segment downstream of this stem-loop. A three-purine bulge interrupts the two stems. This structure was suggested by enzymatic probing with nuclease V1 of an RNA fragment corresponding to the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV-1. The involvement of the novel lower stem in frameshifting was supported by site-directed mutagenesis. A fragment encompassing the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV-1 was inserted in the beginning of the coding sequence of a reporter gene coding for the firefly luciferase, such that expression of luciferase requires a -1 frameshift. When the reporter was expressed in COS cells, mutations that disrupt the capacity to form the lower stem reduced frameshifting, whereas compensatory changes that allow reformation of this stem restored the frameshift efficiency near wild-type level. The two-stem structure that we propose for the frameshift stimulatory signal of HIV-1 differs from the RNA triple helix structure recently proposed.},

Examining the effects of a small-molecule -1 PRF inhibitor active against SARS-CoV-2, it had a similar effect on all mutants tested, regardless of basal -1 PRF efficiency, indicating that anti-frameshifting activity can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations.

   abstract = {Programmed ribosomal frameshifting allows the synthesis of alternative, N-terminally coincident, C-terminally distinct proteins from the same RNA. Many viruses utilize frameshifting to optimize the coding potential of compact genomes, to circumvent the host cell's canonical rule of one functional protein per mRNA, or to express alternative proteins in a fixed ratio. Programmed frameshifting is also used in the decoding of a small number of cellular genes. Recently, specific ribosomal - 1 frameshifting was discovered at a conserved U_UUU_UUA motif within the sequence encoding the alphavirus 6K protein. In this case, frameshifting results in the synthesis of an additional protein, termed TF (TransFrame). This new case of frameshifting is unusual in that the - 1 frame ORF is very short and completely embedded within the sequence encoding the overlapping polyprotein. The present work shows that there is remarkable diversity in the 3' sequences that are functionally important for efficient frameshifting at the U_UUU_UUA motif. While many alphavirus species utilize a 3' RNA structure such as a hairpin or pseudoknot, some species (such as Semliki Forest virus) apparently lack any intra-mRNA stimulatory structure, yet just 20 nt 3'-adjacent to the shift site stimulates up to 10\% frameshifting.

Antisense oligonucleotides annealed appropriately 3' of a slippery sequence have also shown activity in frameshifting, at least in vitro.

By examining-1 and-2 frameshifting outcomes on mRNAs with varying slippery sequence-stimulatory RNA spacing distances, we found that-2 frameshifting was optimal at a spacer length 1-2 nucleotides shorter than that optimal for-1 frameshifting with all stimulatory RNAs tested. We propose that the shorter spacer increases the tension on the mRNA such that when the tRNA detaches, it more readily enters the-2 frame on the U6A heptamer.

The signal is comprised of two elements, a heptanucleotide "slip-site" and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the pseudoknot and its contribution to the frameshift process by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of pseudoknot mutants. Our results show that the pseudoknot structure closely resembles that which can be predicted from current building rules, although base-pair formation at the region where the two pseudoknot stems are thought to stack co-axially is not a pre-requisite for efficient frameshifting. The stems, however, must be in close proximity to generate a functional structure. In general, the removal of a single base-pair contact in either stem is sufficient to reduce or abolish frameshifting. No primary sequence determinants in the stems or loops appear to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient. Thus, small insertions into the pseudoknot loops and a deletion in loop 2 that reduced its length to the predicted functional minimum did not influence frameshifting. However, a large insertion (467 nucleotides) into loop 2 abolished frameshifting. A simple stem-loop structure with a base-paired stem of the same length and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot could not functionally replace the pseudoknot, suggesting that some particular conformational feature of the pseudoknot determines its ability to promote frameshifting. © 1991.},

Protein sequence analysis demonstrated the occurrence of two closeiy related frameshift mechanisms. In the first, ribosomes appear to bind leucyl‐tRNA at the frameshift site and then slip leftward. This is the 'simultaneous slippage’mechanism. In the second, ribosomes appear to slip before binding amlnoacyl‐tRNA, and then bind phenylaianyl‐tRNA, which is encoded in the left‐shifted reading frame.

The efficiency of frameshifting varies widely for different sites, but the factors that determine frameshifting efficiency are not yet fully understood. Previous work has suggested that frameshifting efficiency is related to the resistance of the pseudoknot against mechanical unfolding. We tested this hypothesis by studying the mechanical properties of a panel of pseudoknots with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 2\% to 30\%: four pseudoknots from retroviruses, two from luteoviruses, one from a coronavirus, and a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Using optical tweezers to apply tension across the RNA, we measured the distribution of forces required to unfold each pseudoknot. We found that neither the average unfolding force, nor the unfolding kinetics, nor the parameters describing the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding of the pseudoknot (energy barrier height and distance to the transition state) could be correlated to frameshifting efficiency. These results indicate that the resistance of pseudoknots to mechanical unfolding is not a primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency. However, increased frameshifting efficiency was correlated with an increased tendency to form alternate, incompletely folded structures, suggesting a more complex picture of the role of the pseudoknot involving the conformational dynamics.},

   abstract = {Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a widely used translational mechanism facilitating the expression of two polypeptides from a single mRNA. Commonly, the ribosome interacts with an mRNA secondary structure that promotes -1 frameshifting on a homopolymeric slippery sequence. Recently, we described an unusual -2 frameshifting (-2 PRF) signal directing efficient expression of a transframe protein [nonstructural protein 2TF (nsp2TF)] of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from an alternative reading frame overlapping the viral replicase gene. Unusually, this arterivirus PRF signal lacks an obvious stimulatory RNA secondary structure, but as confirmed here, can also direct the occurrence of -1 PRF, yielding a third, truncated nsp2 variant named "nsp2N." Remarkably, we now show that both -2 and -1 PRF are transactivated by a protein factor, specifically a PRRSV replicase subunit (nsp1β). Embedded in nsp1β's pa-pain-like autoproteinase domain, we identified a highly conserved, putative RNA-binding motif that is critical for PRF transactivation. The minimal RNA sequence required for PRF was mapped within a 34-nt region that includes the slippery sequence and a downstream conserved CCCANCUCC motif. Interaction of nsp1β with the PRF signal was demonstrated in pull-down assays. These studies demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that a protein can function as a transactivator of ribosomal frameshifting. The newly identified frameshifting determinants provide potential antiviral targets for arterivirus disease control and prevention. Moreover, protein-induced transactivation of frameshifting may be a widely used mechanism, potentially including previously undiscovered viral strategies to regulate viral gene expression and/or modulate host cell translation upon infection.},

The mechanism of -1PRF and its timing during translation elongation are unclear. Here, we identified the steps that govern -1PRF by following the stepwise movement of the ribosome through the frameshifting site of a model mRNA derived from the IBV 1a/1b gene in a reconstituted in vitro translation system from Escherichia coli. Frameshifting occurs at a late stage of translocation when the two tRNAs are bound to adjacent slippery sequence codons of the mRNA. The downstream pseudoknot in the mRNA impairs the closing movement of the 30S subunit head, the dissociation of EF-G, and the release of tRNA from the ribosome. The slippage of the ribosome into the -1 frame accelerates the completion of translocation, thereby further favoring translation in the new reading frame. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a linear single-stranded molecule that folds into complex secondary structures by base pairing of stretches of complementary sequences. Translation of mRNA into protein by the ribosome requires disruption of this base pairing. In this study, Ignacio Tinoco and colleagues employ a single molecule approach to show that the ribosome has two mechanisms that assist in opening the structured regions of mRNAs; the choice of mechanism depends on whether the base-paired junction is in an open or closed state. The ribosome translates the genetic information encoded in messenger RNA into protein. Folded structures in the coding region of an mRNA represent a kinetic barrier that lowers the peptide elongation rate, as the ribosome must disrupt structures it encounters in the mRNA at its entry site to allow translocation to the next codon. Such structures are exploited by the cell to create diverse strategies for translation regulation, such as programmed frameshifting1,2, the modulation of protein expression levels3,4, ribosome localization5 and co-translational protein folding6. Although strand separation activity is inherent to the ribosome, requiring no exogenous helicases7, its mechanism is still unknown. Here, using a single-molecule optical tweezers assay on mRNA hairpins, we find that the translation rate of identical codons at the decoding centre is greatly influenced by the GC content of folded structures at the mRNA entry site. Furthermore, force applied to the ends of the hairpin to favour its unfolding significantly speeds translation. Quantitative analysis of the force dependence of its helicase activity reveals that the ribosome, unlike previously studied helicases, uses two distinct active mechanisms to unwind mRNA structure: it destabilizes the helical junction at the mRNA entry site by biasing its thermal fluctuations towards the open state, increasing the probability of the ribosome translocating unhindered; and it mechanically pulls apart the mRNA single strands of the closed junction during the conformational changes that accompany ribosome translocation. The second of these mechanisms ensures a minimal basal rate of translation in the cell; specialized, mechanically stable structures are required to stall the ribosome temporarily1,2. Our results establish a quantitative mechanical basis for understanding the mechanism of regulation of the elongation rate of translation by structured mRNAs.},

   abstract = {Programmed ribosomal frameshifting allows one mRNA to encode regulate expression of, multiple open reading frames (ORFs). The polymerase encoded by ORF 2 of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is expressed via minus one (-1) frameshifting from the overlapping ORF 1. Previously, this appeared to be mediated by a 116 nt RNA sequence that contains canonical -1 frameshift signals including a shifty heptanucleotide followed by a highly structured region. However, unlike known -1 frameshift signals, the reporter system required the zero frame stop codon and did not require a consensus shifty site for expression of the -1 ORF. In contrast, full-length viral RNA required a functional shifty site for frameshifting in wheat germ extract, while the stop codon was not required. Increasing translation initiation efficiency by addition of a 5' cap on the naturally uncapped viral RNA, decreased the frameshift rate. Unlike any other known RNA, a region four kilobases downstream of the frameshift site was required for frameshifting. This included an essential 55 base tract followed by a 179 base tract that contributed to full frameshifting. The effects of most mutations on frameshifting correlated with the ability of viral RNA to replicate in oat protoplasts, indicating that the wheat germ extract accurately reflected control of BYDV RNA translation in the infected cell. However, the overall frameshift rate appeared to be higher in infected cells, based on immunodetection of viral proteins. These findings show that use of short recoding sequences out of context in reporter constructs may overlook distant signals. Most importantly, the remarkably long-distance interaction reported here suggests the presence of a novel structure that can facilitate ribosomal frameshifting. © 2001 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {The ribosomal frameshift signal in the genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV is composed of two elements, a heptanucleotide "slippery-sequence" and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the heptanucleotide stretch UUUAAAC, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the -1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a -2 +1 frameshift product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2\% to 21\%). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RNA pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all those known or suspected to be utilized in vivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and U are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage (XXXYYYN) although C triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXYYYYN), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYYN) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for A-site codons. These observations lead us to suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized "shifty" tRNAs. © 1992.},

   abstract = {Ribosomal frameshifting is a translational mechanism involved in protein synthesis during the replication of many viral pathogens and in cellular genes more generally. A new set of images of an 80S ribosome stalled at an mRNA pseudoknot shows how the pseudoknot manipulates the ribosome into a different reading frame. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging is used to visualize a translating ribosome stalled during frameshifting. The triplet-based genetic code requires that translating ribosomes maintain the reading frame of a messenger RNA faithfully to ensure correct protein synthesis1. However, in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting2, a specific subversion of frame maintenance takes place, wherein the ribosome is forced to shift one nucleotide backwards into an overlapping reading frame and to translate an entirely new sequence of amino acids. This process is indispensable in the replication of numerous viral pathogens, including HIV and the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome3, and is also exploited in the expression of several cellular genes4. Frameshifting is promoted by an mRNA signal composed of two essential elements: a heptanucleotide ‘slippery’ sequence5 and an adjacent mRNA secondary structure, most often an mRNA pseudoknot6. How these components operate together to manipulate the ribosome is unknown. Here we describe the observation of a ribosome–mRNA pseudoknot complex that is stalled in the process of -1 frameshifting. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging of purified mammalian 80S ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes paused at a coronavirus pseudoknot reveals an intermediate of the frameshifting process. From this it can be seen how the pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process and leading to a spring-like deformation of the P-site transfer RNA. In addition, we identify movements of the likely eukaryotic ribosomal helicase and confirm a direct interaction between the translocase eEF2 and the P-site tRNA. Together, the structural changes provide a mechanical explanation of how the pseudoknot manipulates the ribosome into a different reading frame.},

Several coronaviruses, such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are of medical importance, with high mortality rates and, in the case of SARS-CoV, significant pandemic potential. Other coronaviruses, such as Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Avian coronavirus, are important livestock pathogens. Ribosome profiling is a technique which exploits the capacity of the translating ribosome to protect around 30 nucleotides of mRNA from ribonuclease digestion. Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments are purified, subjected to deep sequencing and mapped back to the transcriptome to give a global “snap-shot” of translation. Parallel RNA sequencing allows normalization by transcript abundance. Here we apply ribosome profiling to cells infected with Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), a model coronavirus in the same genus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The data obtained allowed us to study the kinetics of virus transcription and translation with exquisite precision. We studied the timecourse of positive and negative-sense genomic and subgenomic viral RNA production and the relative translation efficiencies of the different virus ORFs. Virus mRNAs were not found to be translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation at later time points due to high levels of virus transcripts. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of translated reading frames and revealed several translated short open reading frames upstream of, or embedded within, known virus protein-coding regions. Ribosome pause sites were identified in the virus replicase polyprotein pp1a ORF and investigated experimentally. Contrary to expectations, ribosomes were not found to pause at the ribosomal frameshift site. To our knowledge this is the first application of ribosome profiling to an RNA virus.},

These mutations decreased the frameshift efficiency to different degrees, ranging from ∼0.3\% to 70\% of the wild-type efficiency. These values were mirrored by a reduced incorporation of Gag-Pol into virus-like particles, as assessed by a decrease in the reverse transcriptase activity associated to these particles. Analysis of Gag processing in infectious mutant virions revealed processing defects to various extents, with no clear correlation with frameshift decrease. Nevertheless, the observed frameshift reductions translated into equivalently reduced viral infectivity and replication kinetics. Our results show that even moderate variations in frameshift efficiency, as obtained with mutations in the frameshift stimulatory signal, reduce viral replication.

   abstract = {Genetic decoding is not 'frozen' as was earlier thought, but dynamic. One facet of this is frameshifting that often results in synthesis of a C-terminal region encoded by a new frame. Ribosomal frameshifting is utilized for the synthesis of additional products, for regulatory purposes and for translational 'correction' of problem or 'savior' indels. Utilization for synthesis of additional products occurs prominently in the decoding of mobile chromosomal element and viral genomes. One class of regulatory frameshifting of stable chromosomal genes governs cellular polyamine levels from yeasts to humans. In many cases of productively utilized frameshifting, the proportion of ribosomes that frameshift at a shift-prone site is enhanced by specific nascent peptide or mRNA context features. Such mRNA signals, which can be 5' or 3' of the shift site or both, can act by pairing with ribosomal RNA or as stem loops or pseudoknots even with one component being 4 kb 3' from the shift site. Transcriptional realignment at slippage-prone sequences also generates productively utilized products encoded trans-frame with respect to the genomic sequence. This too can be enhanced by nucleic acid structure. Together with dynamic codon redefinition, frameshifting is one of the forms of recoding that enriches gene expression.},

   abstract = {At the end of my doctoral studies, in 1988, I published a review article on the major steps of transcription and translation during the mammalian reovirus multiplication cycle, a topic that still fascinates me 30 years later. It is in the nature of scientific research to generate further questioning as new knowledge emerges. Our understanding of these fascinating viruses thus remains incomplete but it seemed appropriate at this moment to look back and reflect on our progress and most important questions that still puzzle us. It is also essential of being careful about concepts that seem so well established, but could still be better validated using new approaches. I hope that the few reflections presented here will stimulate discussions and maybe attract new investigators into the field of reovirus research. Many other aspects of the viral multiplication cycle would merit our attention. However, I will essentially limit my discussion to these central aspects of the viral cycle that are transcription of viral genes and their phenotypic expression through the host cell translational machinery. The objective here is not to review every aspect but to put more emphasis on important progress and challenges in the field.},

   abstract = {Initiation is the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis and therefore an important target for regulation. For the initiation of translation of most cellular mRNAs, the cap structure at the 5' end is bound by the translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), while the poly(A) tail, at the 3' end, is recognized by the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). eIF4G is a scaffold protein that brings together eIF4E and PABP, causing the circularization of the mRNA that is thought to be important for an efficient initiation of translation. Early in infection, rotaviruses take over the host translation machinery, causing a severe shutoff of cell protein synthesis. Rotavirus mRNAs lack a poly(A) tail but have instead a consensus sequence at their 3' ends that is bound by the viral nonstructural protein NSP3, which also interacts with eIF4GI, using the same region employed by PABP. It is widely believed that these interactions lead to the translation of rotaviral mRNAs, impairing at the same time the translation of cellular mRNAs. In this work, the expression of NSP3 in infected cells was knocked down using RNA interference. Unexpectedly, under these conditions the synthesis of viral proteins was not decreased, while the cellular protein synthesis was restored. Also, the yield of viral progeny increased, which correlated with an increased synthesis of viral RNA. Silencing the expression of eIF4GI further confirmed that the interaction between eIF4GI and NSP3 is not required for viral protein synthesis. These results indicate that NSP3 is neither required for the translation of viral mRNAs nor essential for virus replication in cell culture.},

Following infection, flaviviral RNA genomes are translated to produce the viral replication machinery but must then serve as a template for the transcription of new genomes. However, the ribosome and viral polymerase proceed in opposite directions along the RNA, risking collisions and abortive replication. Whilst generally linear, flavivirus genomes can adopt a circular conformation facilitated by long-range RNA–RNA interactions, shown to be essential for replication. Using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we demonstrate that circularization inhibits de novo translation initiation on ZIKV and DENV RNA, whilst the linear conformation is translation-competent. Our results provide a mechanism to clear the viral RNA of ribosomes in order to promote efficient replication and, therefore, define opposing roles for linear and circular conformations of the flavivirus genome.},

   abstract = {Picornaviruses use internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) to translate their genomes into protein. A typical feature of these IRESs is their ability to bind directly to the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G component of the eIF4F cap-binding complex. Remarkably, the hepatitis A virus (HAV) IRES requires eIF4E for its translation, but no mechanism has been proposed to explain this. Here we demonstrate that eIF4E regulates HAV IRES-mediated translation by two distinct mechanisms. First, eIF4E binding to eIF4G generates a high-affinity binding conformation of the eIF4F complex for the IRES. Second, eIF4E binding to eIF4G strongly stimulates the rate of duplex unwinding by eIF4A on the IRES. Our data also reveal that eIF4E promotes eIF4F binding and increases the rate of restructuring of the poliovirus (PV) IRES. This provides a mechanism to explain why PV IRES-mediated translation is stimulated by eIF4E availability in nuclease-treated cell-free extracts. Using a PV replicon and purified virion RNA, we also show that eIF4E promotes the rate of eIF4G cleavage by the 2A protease. Finally, we show that cleavage of eIF4G by the poliovirus 2A protease generates a high-affinity IRES binding truncation of eIF4G that stimulates eIF4A duplex unwinding independently of eIF4E. Therefore, our data reveal how picornavirus IRESs use eIF4E-dependent and -independent mechanisms to promote their translation.},

Besides the previously reported 5'CS/3'CSI (conserved sequence) interaction, a 5'UAR/3'UAR (upstream AUG region) interaction also contributes to genome cyclization and replication. WNVs containing mutant 5'UARs capable of forming the 5'/3' viral RNA interaction were replicative. In contrast, WNV containing a 5'UAR mutation that abolished the 5'/3' viral RNA interaction was non-replicative; however, the replication defect could be rescued by a single-nucleotide adaptation that restored the 5'/3' RNA interaction. The 5'UAR/3'UAR interaction is critical for RNA synthesis, but not for viral translation. Antisense oligomers targeting the 5'UAR/3'UAR interaction effectively inhibited WNV replication. Phylogenic analysis showed that the 3'UAR could alternate between pairing with the 5'UAR or with the 3' end of the flaviviral genome. Therefore, the 5'UAR/3'UAR pairing may release the 3' end of viral genome (as a template) during the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The plasticity of viral plus strand RNA genomes is fundamental for the multiple functions of these molecules. Local and long-range RNA - RNA interactions provide the scaffold for interacting proteins of the translation, replication, and encapsidation machinery. Using dengue virus as a model, we investigated the relevance of the interplay between two alternative conformations of the viral genome during replication. Flaviviruses require long-range RNA - RNA interactions and genome cyclization for RNA synthesis. Here, we define a sequence present in the viral 3'UTR that overlaps two mutually exclusive structures. This sequence can form an extended duplex by long-range 5'-3' interactions in the circular conformation of the RNA or fold locally into a small hairpin (sHP) in the linear form of the genome. A mutational analysis of the sHP structure revealed an absolute requirement of this element for viral viability, suggesting the need of a linear conformation of the genome. Viral RNA replication showed high vulnerability to changes that alter the balance between circular and linear forms of the RNA. Mutations that shift the equilibrium toward the circular or the linear conformation of the genome spontaneously revert to sequences with different mutations that tend to restore the relative stability of the two competing structures. We propose a model in which the viral genome exists in at least two alternative conformations and the balance between these two states is critical for infectivity.

These motifs are highly conserved throughout the Flavivirus genus and occur both in mature virions and within infected cells.

Interestingly, both functions are driven by the genomic 5'-UTR (5'-untranslated region), which harbours structural RNA motifs for the replication cycle of the virus. Recent work has shown that this RNA architecture also functions as an IRES (internal ribosome entry site) in HIV-1 and -2, and in SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus). In addition, the IRES extends to the gag coding region for all these viruses and this leads to the synthesis of shorter isoforms of the Gag polyprotein from downstream initiation codons. In the present study, we have investigated how different members of the lentivirus family (namely HIV-1 and -2, and SIV) can initiate protein synthesis by distinct mechanisms. For this, we have used the competitive reticulocyte lysate that we have recently described. our results show that HIV-1 is able to drive the synthesis of the Gag polyprotein both by a classical cap-dependent mechanism and an IRES, whereas HIV-2 and SIV appear to use exclusively an IRES mechanism. © The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Biochemical Society.},

   abstract = {Through its interaction with the 5' translation initiation factor eIF4G, poly(A) binding protein (PABP) facilitates the translation of 5'-capped and 3'-poly(A)-tailed mRNAs. Rotavirus mRNAs are capped but not polyadenylated, instead terminating in a 3' GACC motif that is recognized by the viral protein NSP3, which competes with PABP for eIF4G binding. Upon rotavirus infection, viral, GACC-tailed mRNAs are efficiently translated, while host poly(A)-tailed mRNA translation is, in contrast, severely impaired. To explore the roles of NSP3 in these two opposing events, the translational capabilities of three capped mRNAs, distinguished by either a GACC, a poly(A), or a non-GACC and nonpoly(A) 3' end, have been monitored after electroporation of cells expressing all rotavirus proteins (infected cells) or only NSP3 (stably or transiently transfected cells). In infected cells, we found that the magnitudes of translation induction (GACC-tailed mRNA) and translation reduction [poly(A)-tailed mRNA] both depended on the rotavirus strain used but that translation reduction not genetically linked to NSP3. In transfected cells, even a small amount of NSP3 was sufficient to dramatically enhance GACC-tailed mRNA translation and, surprisingly, to slightly favor the translation of both poly(A)- and nonpoly(A)-tailed mRNAs, likely by stabilizing the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction. These data suggest that NSP3 is a translational surrogate of the PABP-poly(A) complex; therefore, it cannot by itself be responsible for inhibiting the translation of host poly(A)-tailed mRNAs upon rotavirus infection. IMPORTANCE To control host cell physiology and to circumvent innate immunity, many viruses have evolved powerful mechanisms aimed at inhibiting host mRNA translation while stimulating translation of their own mRNAs. How rotavirus tackles this challenge is still a matter of debate. Using rotavirus-infected cells, we show that the magnitude of cellular poly(A) mRNA translation differs with respect to rotavirus strains but is not genetically linked to NSP3. Using cells expressing rotavirus NSP3, we show that NSP3 alone not only dramatically enhances rotavirus-like mRNA translation but also enhances poly(A) mRNA translation rather than inhibiting it, likely by stabilizing the eIF4E-eIF4G complex. Thus, the inhibition of cellular polyadenylated mRNA translation during rotavirus infection cannot be attributed solely to NSP3 and is more likely the result of global competition between viral and host mRNAs for the cellular translation machinery. },

   abstract = {Rotaviruses are an important cause of human morbidity and mortality, representing the primary pathogens responsible for acute dehydrating diarrhea in children under the age of 3. The infectious rotavirus particle is made up of three concentric layers of protein, and contains a genome consisting of eleven segments of double-stranded (ds)RNA. Upon infection, RNA polymerases associated with double-layered virus particles are activated, resulting in genome transcription and extrusion of the eleven viral mRNAs from such particles. The mRNAs not only direct protein synthesis, but also serve as templates for minus-strand synthesis to yield dsRNAs. Synthesis of the dsRNAs is an event that occurs following the gene-specific packaging of viral mRNAs into core-like assembly intermediates. Electron-dense cytoplasmic inclusions, termed viroplasms, function as sites of genome packaging and replication in the infected cell. Our understanding of key events in the viral life cycle has been advanced considerably by the development of cell-free systems that support mRNA synthesis from virion-derived double-layered particles and dsRNA synthesis from virion-derived core particles. The recent expression and purification of rotavirus recombinant proteins have also allowed progress to be made in defining the roles of viral proteins in genome replication and viroplasm formation. However, our efforts towards a full description of the viral life cycle, most notably an understanding of the events occurring during gene-specific packaging, remain hampered by the lack of a cell-free packaging system and a reverse genetics systems. The lack of a reverse genetics systems also confounds efforts towards the generation of molecular engineered second-generation vaccines. © 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

In the case of flaviviruses, the presence of inverted complementary sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of the genome mediate long-range RNA interactions and RNA cyclization. The circular conformation of flavivirus genomes was demonstrated to be essential for RNA amplification. New ideas about the mechanisms by which circular genomes participate in flavivirus replication have emerged in the last few years.

The molecular mechanisms of calicivirus genome replication and translation have not been as widely studied as many other RNA viruses. With the relatively recent development of robust cell culture and reverse genetics systems for several members of the Caliciviridae family, a more in-depth analysis of the finer detail of the viral life cycle has now been obtained. As a result, the identification and characterization of the role of RNA structures in the calicivirus life cycle has also been possible.

The recent description of calicivirus genomes with 500-900nt long 5'UTRs was therefore unexpected and prompted us to examine them in detail. Sequence analysis and structural modelling of the atypically long 5'UTRs of Caliciviridae sp. isolate yc-13 and six other caliciviruses suggested that they contain picornavirus-like type 2 IRESs, whereas ruddy turnstone calicivirus (RTCV) and Caliciviridae sp. isolate hwf182cal1 calicivirus contain type 4 and type 5 IRESs, respectively. The suggestion that initiation on RTCV mRNA occurs by the type 4 IRES mechanism was confirmed experimentally using in vitro reconstitution. The high sequence identity between identified calicivirus IRESs and specific picornavirus IRESs suggests a common evolutionary origin. These calicivirus IRESs occur in a single phylogenetic branch of Caliciviridae and were likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer.},

The coding capacity of these RNA viruses is rather limited, and thus, they rely on the cellular machinery for their viral replication cycle. Upon the entry of the virus into susceptible cells, the viral RNA initially competes with cellular mRNAs for access to the protein synthesis machinery. Not surprisingly, picornaviruses have evolved specialized strategies that successfully allow the expression of viral gene products, which we outline in this review. The main feature of all picornavirus genomes is the presence of a heavily structured RNA element on the 5´UTR, referred to as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element, which directs viral protein synthesis as well and, consequently, triggers the subsequent steps required for viral replication. Here, we will summarize recent studies showing that picornavirus IRES elements consist of a modular structure, providing sites of interaction for ribosome subunits, eIFs, and a selective group of RNA-binding proteins.},

In particular, initiation of translation driven by the IRES element of foot-and-mouth disease virus is stimulated by the 3΄UTR. Here we sought to investigate the RNA local flexibility of the IRES element and the 3΄UTR in living cells. The SHAPE reactivity observed in vivo showed statistically significant differences compared to the free RNA, revealing protected or exposed positions within the IRES and the 3΄UTR. Importantly, the IRES local flexibility was modified in the presence of the 3΄UTR, showing significant protections at residues upstream from the functional start codon. Conversely, presence of the IRES element in cis altered the 3΄UTR local flexibility leading to an overall enhanced reactivity. Unlike the reactivity changes observed in the IRES element, the SHAPE differences of the 3΄UTR were large but not statistically significant, suggesting multiple dynamic RNA interactions. These results were supported by covariation analysis, which predicted IRES-3΄UTR conserved helices in agreement with the protections observed by SHAPE probing. Mutational analysis suggested that disruption of one of these interactions could be compensated by alternative base pairings, providing direct evidences for dynamic long-range interactions between these distant elements of the viral genome.},

In the 5' UTR, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element governs cap-independent translation initiation, whereas the S region is presumably involved in RNA replication. The 3' UTR, composed of two stem-loops and a poly(A) tract, is required for viral infectivity and stimulates IRES activity. Here, it was found that the 3' end established two distinct strand-specific, long-range RNA-RNA interactions, one with the S region and another with the IRES element. These interactions were not observed with the 3' UTR of a different picornavirus. Several results indicated that different 3' UTR motifs participated in IRES or S region interactions. Firstly, a high-order structure adopted by both the entire IRES and the 3' UTR was essential for RNA interaction. In contrast, the S region interacted with each of the stem-loops. Secondly, S-3' UTR interaction but not IRES-3' UTR interaction was dependent on a poly(A)-dependent conformation. However, no other complexes were observed in mixtures containing the three transcripts, suggesting that these regions did not interact simultaneously with the 3' UTR probe. Cellular proteins have been found to bind the S region and one of these also binds to the 3' UTR in a competitive manner. Our data suggest that 5'-3'-end bridging through both direct RNA-RNA contacts and RNA-protein interactions may play an essential role in the FMDV replication cycle. © 2006 SGM.},

   abstract = {The 3' end region of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) consists of two distinct elements, a 90 nt untranslated region (3'-NCR) and a poly(A) tract. Removal of either the poly(A) tract or both the 3'-NCR and the poly(A) tract abrogated infectivity in susceptible cells in the context of a full-length cDNA clone. We have addressed the question of whether the impairment of RNA infectivity is related to defects at the translation level using a double approach. First, compared to the full-length viral RNA, removal of the 3' sequences reduced the efficiency of translation in vitro. Secondly, a stimulatory effect of the 3' end sequences on IRES-dependent translation was found in vivo using bicistronic constructs. RNAs carrying the FMDV 3' end sequences linked to the second cistron showed a significant stimulation of IRES-dependent translation, whereas cap-dependent translation was not affected. Remarkably, IRES-dependent stimulation exerted by the poly(A) tract or the 3'-NCR seems to be the result of two separate events, as the 3'-NCR alone enhanced IRES activity on its own. Under conditions of FMDV Lb protease-induced translation shut-off, the stimulation of IRES activity reached values above 6-fold in living cells. A northern blot analysis indicated that IRES stimulation was not the consequence of a change in the stability of the bicistronic RNA produced in transfected cells. Analysis of the RNA-binding proteins interacting with a mixture of 3' end and IRES probes showed an additive pattern. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that individual signals in the viral 3' end ensure stimulation of FMDV translation.},

We have developed and characterized a cell-free system from human HeLa cells that recapitulates this important feature, displaying more than one order of magnitude of translational synergism between the cap structure and the poly(A) tail. The stimulation of cap-dependent translation by the poly(A) tail is length-dependent, but not mediated by changes in mRNA stability. Using this system, we investigated the effect of the poly(A) tail on the translation of picornaviral RNAs, which are naturally polyadenylated but initiate translation via internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). We show that translation driven by the IRESs of poliovirus (PV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and hepatitis A virus is also significantly augmented by a poly(A) tail, ranging from an approximately 3-fold stimulation for the EMCV-IRES to a more than 10-fold effect for the PV IRES. These results raise interesting questions concerning the underlying molecular mechanism(s). The cell-free system described here should prove useful in studying these questions as well as providing a general biochemical tool to examine the translation initiation pathway in a more physiological setting.},

   abstract = {RNA viruses are ubiquitous in nature, infecting every known organism on the planet. These viruses can also be notorious human pathogens with significant medical and economic burdens. Central to the lifecycle of an RNA virus is the synthesis of new RNA molecules, a process that is mediated by specialized virally encoded enzymes called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). RdRps directly catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA-templated manner. These enzymes are strikingly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families. During host cell infection, the activities of viral RdRps are often regulated by viral cofactor proteins. Cofactors can modulate the type and timing of RNA synthesis by directly engaging the RdRp and/or by indirectly affecting its capacity to recognize template RNA. High-resolution structures of RdRps as apoenzymes, bound to RNA templates, in the midst of catalysis, and/or interacting with regulatory cofactor proteins, have dramatically increased our understanding of viral RNA synthetic mechanisms. Combined with elegant biochemical studies, such structures are providing a scientific platform for the rational design of antiviral agents aimed at preventing and treating RNA virus-induced diseases. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {In metazoans, replication-dependent histone mRNAs end in a stem-loop structure instead of the poly(A) tail characteristic of all other mature mRNAs. This specialized 3' end is bound by stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), a protein that participates in the nuclear export and translation of histone mRNAs. The translational activity of SLBP is mediated by interaction with SLIP1, a middle domain of initiation factor 4G (MIF4G)-like protein that connects to translation initiation. We determined the 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of zebrafish SLIP1 bound to the translation-activation domain of SLBP and identified the determinants of the recognition. We discovered a SLIP1-binding motif (SBM) in two additional proteins: the translation initiation factor eIF3g and the mRNA-export factor DBP5. We confirmed the binding of SLIP1 to DBP5 and eIF3g by pull-down assays and determined the 3.25 Å resolution structure of SLIP1 bound to the DBP5 SBM. The SBM-binding and homodimerization residues of SLIP1 are conserved in the MIF4G domain of CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF). The results suggest how the SLIP1 homodimer or a SLIP1-CTIF heterodimer can function as platforms to bridge SLBP with SBM-containing proteins involved in different steps of mRNA metabolism. © 2013 The Author(s).},

This subunit of the eIF3 translation initiation factor that includes a PCI domain exhibits specific features such as presence in the nucleus and ability to interact with other important cellular protein complexes like the 26S proteasome and the COP9 signalosome. It has been previously shown that INT6 was not essential for bulk translation, and this protein is considered to regulate expression of specific mRNAs. Based on the results of a two-hybrid screen performed with INT6 as bait, we characterize in this article the MIF4GD/SLIP1 protein as an interactor of this eIF3 subunit. MIF4GD was previously shown to associate with SLBP, which binds the stem-loop located at the 3' end of the histone mRNAs, and to be necessary for efficient translation of these cell cycle-regulated mRNAs that lack a poly(A) tail. In line with the interaction of both proteins, we show using the RNA interference approach that INT6 is also essential to S-phase histone mRNA translation. This was observed by analyzing expression of endogenous histones and by testing heterologous constructs placing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the stem-loop element of various histone genes. With such a reporter plasmid, silencing and overexpression of INT6 exerted opposite effects. In agreement with these results, INT6 and MIF4GD were observed to colocalize in cytoplasmic foci. We conclude from these data that INT6, by establishing interactions with MIF4GD and SLBP, plays an important role in translation of poly(A) minus histone mRNAs.

Using the interaction between these factors and the opposing ends of mRNAs as a proxy for the closed-loop, we provide evidence that it is prevalent for eIF4E/4G-bound but unexpectedly sparse for PAB1-bound mRNAs, suggesting it primarily occurs during a distinct phase of polysome assembly.

It is now well recognized that almost all mRNAs whose biosynthesis originates within nuclei contain a 3' poly(A) tail. Poly(A) sequences are not encoded within genes (Philipson et al. 1971; Birnboim et al. 1973; Jacobson et al. 1974) but are added to nascent pre-mRNAs in a processing reaction that involves site-specific cleavage and subsequent polyadenylation. The site of cleavage is determined by a highly conserved AAUAAA sequence usually 5–30 nucleotides 5' to the site and by other less well-conserved sequences 3', and sometimes 5', to the site. Cleavage and polyadenylation are dependent on poly(A) polymerase and several other factors that impart specificity and processivity to the reaction. For reviews on the sequence and factor requirements of polyadenylation, see Wickens (1990), Proudfoot (1991), Wahle and Keller (1992), and Manley and Proudfoot (1994). Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that a large fraction of newly synthesized nuclear poly(A) was conserved in cytoplasmic mRNA (Puckett et al. 1975). These experiments provided early support for the notion that heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) was the precursor to mRNA and also forced the conclusion that at least one function of poly(A) must be cytoplasmic.

This circularization is thought to promote the engagement of terminating ribosomes to a new round of translation at the same mRNA molecule, thus enhancing protein synthesis. Despite the general acceptance and the elegance of the hypothesis, it has never been proved experimentally. Using continuous in situ monitoring of luciferase synthesis in a mammalian in vitro system, we show here that the rate of translation initiation at capped and polyadenylated reporter mRNAs increases after the time required for the first ribosomes to complete mRNA translation. Such acceleration strictly requires the presence of a poly(A)-tail and is abrogated by the addition of poly(A) RNA fragments or m7GpppG cap analog to the translation reaction. The optimal functional interaction of mRNA termini requires 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR of moderate lengths and provides stronger acceleration, thus a longer poly(A)-tail. Besides, we revealed that the inhibitory effect of the dominant negative R362Q mutant of initiation factor eIF4A diminishes in the course of translation reaction, suggesting a relaxed requirement for ATP.

   abstract = {Electron microscopy of sections of rabbit reticulocytes reveals that the ribosomes are arranged in groups or clusters. Those with four or five 80 s-ribosomes predominate, with the particles arranged as if on the circumference of a circle. Isolated ribosome preparations, viewed by positive or negative staining, show similar aggregates, or “polysomes”, although at times the ribosomes in isolated preparations appear to be arranged in a line and connected by a strand of densely stained material. On analytical or density-gradient centrifugation of cell lysates or isolated ribosome preparations, peaks of sedimentation coefficient from 80 s to 250 s are seen. Examination by electron microscopy of material from each peak demonstrates that they correspond to aggregates of a definite number of ribosomes. The ribosomes of the polysome are linked by a substance sensitive to very low concentrations of pancreatic ribonuclease, presumably an RNA molecule. Rapid incorporation of amino acid into polysomes was demonstrated. RNA, isolated by a lithium chloride technique, was tested for its ability to enhance incorporation of amino acid; the 16 s, 28 s and 41 s components all gave roughly equal enhancement. Assays were performed to measure the leucine aminopeptidase and ribonuclease activities associated with isolated ribosomes. Only very low levels of both enzymes were found. © 1964, Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd.. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Most eukaryotic mRNAs are recruited to the ribosome by recognition of a 5ʹ m7GpppN cap. 30 years of genetic and biochemical evidence point to a role for interaction between the 5ʹ cap-interacting factors and the 3ʹ poly(A)-binding protein in bringing the ends of the mRNA into close proximity and promoting both translation and stability of the mRNA, in a form known as the “closed loop”. However, the results of recent RNA–protein interaction studies suggest that not all mRNAs have equal access to the closed loop factors. Furthermore, association with closed loop factors appears to be highly biased towards mRNAs with short open reading frames, echoing the trend for higher translation of short mRNAs that has been observed in many eukaryotes. We recently reported that the ribosomal signaling scaffold protein RACK1 promotes the efficient translation of short mRNAs that strongly associate with the closed loop factors. Here, we discuss the implications of these observations with respect to translational control and suggest avenues through which the universality of the closed loop in eukaryotic translation could be revisited.},

The 3' and 5' terminal regions contain short conserved sequences that are proposed to be repeated remnants of an ancient sequence. However, the functions of most of these conserved sequences have not yet been determined. The terminal regions of the genome also contain multiple conserved RNA structures. Functional data for many of these structures have been obtained. Three sets of complementary 3' and 5' terminal region sequences, some of which are located in conserved RNA structures, interact to form a panhandle structure that is required for initiation of minus strand RNA synthesis with the 5' terminal structure functioning as the promoter. How the switch from the terminal RNA structure base pairing to the long distance RNA-RNA interaction is triggered and regulated is not well understood but evidence suggests involvement of a cell protein binding to three sites on the 3' terminal RNA structures and a cis-acting metastable 3' RNA element in the 3' terminal RNA structure. Cell proteins may also be involved in facilitating exponential replication of nascent genomic RNA within replication vesicles at later times of the infection cycle. Other conserved RNA structures and/or sequences in the 3' and 5' terminal regions have been proposed to regulate genome translation. Additional functions of the 3' and 5' terminal sequences have also been reported.},

Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable cis-acting element named 50-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 50 terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 50 end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses.},

We report canonical and alternative structures including 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR, frameshifting element (FSE) pseudoknot and genome cyclization in both cells and virions. We provide direct evidence of interactions between Transcription Regulating Sequences, which facilitate discontinuous transcription. In addition, we reveal alternative short and long distance arches around FSE. More importantly, we find that within virions, while SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA undergoes intensive compaction, genome domains remain stable but with strengthened demarcation of local domains and weakened global cyclization. Taken together, our analysis reveals the structural basis for the regulation of replication, discontinuous transcription and translational frameshifting, the alternative conformations and the maintenance of global genome organization during the whole life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, which we anticipate will help develop better antiviral strategies.

Comparative analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous mutation rates. Interaction mapping by SPLASH identifies many pair-wise interactions, 40\% of which form alternative structures, suggesting extensive structural heterogeneity. Analysis of shared interactions between serotypes reveals a conserved macro-organization whereby interactions can be preserved at physical locations beyond sequence identities. We further observe that longer-range interactions are preferentially disrupted inside cells, and show the importance of new interactions in virus fitness. These findings deepen our understanding of Flavivirus genome organization and serve as a resource for designing therapeutics in targeting RNA viruses.

   abstract = { A possible role in RNA replication for interactions between conserved complementary (cyclization) sequences in the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of Flavivirus RNA was previously suggested but never tested in vivo. Using the M-fold program for RNA secondary-structure predictions, we examined for the first time the base-pairing interactions between the covalently linked 5' genomic region (first ∼160 nucleotides) and the 3' untranslated region (last ∼115 nucleotides) for a range of mosquito-borne Flavivirus species. Base-pairing occurred as predicted for the previously proposed conserved cyclization sequences. In order to obtain experimental evidence of the predicted interactions, the putative cyclization sequences (5' or 3') in the replicon RNA of the mosquito-borne Kunjin virus were mutated either separately, to destroy base-pairing, or simultaneously, to restore the complementarity. None of the RNAs with separate mutations in only the 5' or only the 3' cyclization sequences was able to replicate after transfection into BHK cells, while replicon RNA with simultaneous compensatory mutations in both cyclization sequences was replication competent. This was detected by immunofluorescence for expression of the major nonstructural protein NS3 and by Northern blot analysis for amplification and accumulation of replicon RNA. We then used the M-fold program to analyze RNA secondary structure of the covalently linked 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of three tick-borne virus species and identified a previously undescribed additional pair of conserved complementary sequences in locations similar to those of the mosquito-borne species. They base-paired with Δ G values of approximately -20 kcal, equivalent or greater in stability than those calculated for the originally proposed cyclization sequences. The results show that the base-pairing between 5' and 3' complementary sequences, rather than the nucleotide sequence per se, is essential for the replication of mosquito-borne Kunjin virus RNA and that more than one pair of cyclization sequences might be involved in the replication of the tick-borne Flavivirus species. },

   abstract = { RNA viruses have 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that contain specific signals for RNA synthesis. The coronavirus genome is capped at the 5' end and has a 3' UTR that consists of 300 to 500 nucleotides (nt) plus a poly(A) tail. To further our understanding of coronavirus replication, we have begun to examine the involvement of host factors in this process for two group II viruses, bovine coronavirus (BCV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Specific host protein interactions with the BCV 3' UTR [287 nt plus poly(A) tail] were identified using gel mobility shift assays. Competition with the MHV 3' UTR [301 nt plus poly(A) tail] suggests that the interactions are conserved for the two viruses. Proteins with molecular masses of 99, 95, and 73 kDa were detected in UV cross-linking experiments. Less heavily labeled proteins were also detected in the ranges of 40 to 50 and 30 kDa. The poly(A) tail was required for binding of the 73-kDa protein. Immunoprecipitation of UV-cross-linked proteins identified the 73-kDa protein as the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Replication of the defective genomes BCV Drep and MHV MIDI-C, along with several mutants, was used to determine the importance of the poly(A) tail. Defective genomes with shortened poly(A) tails consisting of 5 or 10 A residues were replicated after transfection into helper virus-infected cells. BCV Drep RNA that lacked a poly(A) tail did not replicate, whereas replication of MHV MIDI-C RNA with a deleted tail was detected after several virus passages. All mutants exhibited delayed kinetics of replication. Detectable extension or addition of the poly(A) tail to the mutants correlated with the appearance of these RNAs in the replication assay. RNAs with shortened poly(A) tails exhibited less in vitro PABP binding, suggesting that decreased interactions with the protein may affect RNA replication. The data strongly indicate that the poly(A) tail is an important cis -acting signal for coronavirus replication. },

   abstract = {Secondary and tertiary RNA structures present in viral RNA genomes play essential regulatory roles during translation, RNA replication, and assembly of new viral particles. In the case of flaviviruses, RNA-RNA interactions between the 5' and 3' ends of the genome have been proposed to be required for RNA replication. We found that two RNA elements present at the ends of the dengue virus genome interact in vitro with high affinity. Visualization of individual molecules by atomic force microscopy reveled that physical interaction between these RNA elements results in cyclization of the viral RNA. Using RNA binding assays, we found that the putative cyclization sequences, known as 5' and 3' CS, present in all mosquito-borne flaviviruses, were necessary but not sufficient for RNA-RNA interaction. Additional sequences present at the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the viral RNA were also required for RNA-RNA complex formation. We named these sequences 5' and 3' UAR (upstream AUG region). In order to investigate the functional role of 5'-3' UAR complementarity, these sequences were mutated either separately, to destroy base pairing, or simultaneously, to restore complementarity in the context of full-length dengue virus RNA. Nonviable viruses were recovered after transfection of dengue virus RNA carrying mutations either at the 5' or 3' UAR, while the RNA containing the compensatory mutations was able to replicate. Since sequence complementarity between the ends of the genome is required for dengue virus viability, we propose that cyclization of the RNA is a required conformation for viral replication.},

Homodimerization of NSP3-C yields a symmetric, elongated, largely α-helical structure with two hydrophobic eIF4G binding pockets at the dimer interface.

We show that an uncapped, nonpolyadenylated plant viral mRNA forms a closed loop by direct base-pairing (kissing) of a stem loop in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) with a stem loop in the 5' UTR. This allows a sequence in the 3' UTR to confer translation initiation at the 5'-proximal AUG. This base-pairing is also required for replication. Unlike other cap-independent translation mechanisms, the ribosome enters at the 5' end of the mRNA. This remarkably long-distance base-pairing reveals a novel mechanism of cap-independent translation and means by which mRNA UTRs can communicate.},

   abstract = {In 2012, a new feature of eukaryotic gene expression emerged: ubiquitous expression of circular RNA (circRNA) from genes traditionally thought to express messenger or linear noncoding (nc)RNA only. CircRNAs are covalently closed, circular RNA molecules that typically comprise exonic sequences and are spliced at canonical splice sites. This feature of gene expression was first recognized in humans and mouse, but it quickly emerged that it was common across essentially all eukaryotes studied by molecular biologists. CircRNA abundance, and even which alternatively spliced circRNA isoforms are expressed, varies by cell type and can exceed the abundance of the traditional linear mRNA or ncRNA transcript. CircRNAs are enriched in the brain and increase in abundance during fetal development. Together, these features raise fundamental questions regarding the regulation of circRNA in cis and in trans, and its function. Many circRNAs have recently been discovered and characterized.Recently, much light has been shed on the regulation and function of circRNAs. CircRNA has been posited to function as a miRNA or RNA-binding protein sponge. However, a general function has not been identified.Developmental regulation of circRNA and enrichment in the nervous system are an emerging theme shared by circRNAs across the metazoan lineage, from flies to humans.CircRNAs can be joined by 3'-5' linkages, containing only exonic sequence; 2'-5' linkages (intronic lariats); or 3'-5' linkages that contain retained intronic sequences.},

   abstract = {Translation initiation is a multistep process involving several canonical translation factors, which assemble at the 5'-end of the mRNA to promote the recruitment of the ribosome. Although the 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs and its major bound protein, the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), have been studied extensively, their mechanism of action in translation is not well understood and is confounded by differences between in vivo and in vitro systems. Here, we provide direct evidence for the involvement of PABP in key steps of the translation initiation pathway. Using a new technique to deplete PABP from mammalian cell extracts, we show that extracts lacking PABP exhibit dramatically reduced rates of translation, reduced efficiency of 48S and 80S ribosome initiation complex formation, and impaired interaction of eIF4E with the mRNA cap structure. Supplementing PABP-depleted extracts with wild-type PABP completely rectified these deficiencies, whereas a mutant of PABP, M161A, which is incapable of interacting with eIF4G, failed to restore translation. In addition, a stronger inhibition (approximately twofold) of 80S as compared to 48S ribosome complex formation (∼65\% vs. ∼35\%, respectively) by PABP depletion suggests that PABP plays a direct role in 60S subunit joining. PABP can thus be considered a canonical translation initiation factor, integral to initiation complex formation at the 5'-end of mRNA.},

The ability of the ribosome to change translational reading frames in the -1 direction (-1 PRF) is employed by many positive strand RNA viruses, including economically important plant viruses and many human pathogens, such as retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, and coronaviruses, e.g., the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in order to properly express their genomes. -1 PRF is programmed by a bipartite signal embedded in the mRNA and includes a heptanucleotide "slip site" over which the paused ribosome "backs up" by one nucleotide, and a downstream stimulatory element, either an RNA pseudoknot or a very stable RNA stem-loop. These two elements are separated by six to eight nucleotides, a distance that places the 5' edge of the downstream stimulatory element in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the 30S ribosomal subunit. The precise mechanism by which the downstream RNA stimulates -1 PRF by the translocating ribosome remains unclear. This review summarizes the recent structural and biophysical studies of RNA pseudoknots and places this work in the context of our evolving mechanistic understanding of translation elongation. Support for the hypothesis that the downstream stimulatory element provides a kinetic barrier to the ribosome-mediated unfolding is discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An open question is whether proteins might function as trans-acting switches to turn frameshifting on or off in response to cellular conditions. Here we show that frameshifting in a model RNA virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, is trans-activated by viral protein 2A. As a result, the frameshifting efficiency increases from 0 to 70\% (one of the highest known in a mammalian system) over the course of infection, temporally regulating the expression levels of the viral structural and enzymatic proteins. Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a mechanism whereby specific signals within mRNAs direct ribosomes to shift into an alternative reading frame.

We carried out a sequence comparison of 1,000 HIV-1 sequences at the slippery site (UUUUUUA) and found that the site is invariant, which is somewhat surprising for a virus known for its variability. This prompted us to prepare a series of mutations to examine their effect upon frameshifting and viral infectivity. Among the series of mutations were changes of the HIV-1 slippery site to those effectively utilized by other viruses, because such mutations would be anticipated to have a relatively mild effect upon frameshifting. The results demonstrate that any change to the slippery site reduced frameshifting levels and also dramatically inhibited infectivity. Because ribosomal frameshifting is essential for HIV-1 replication and it is surprisingly resistant to mutation, modulation of HIV-1 frameshifting efficiency potentially represents an important target for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics.},

   abstract = {This review takes a second look at a set of mRNAs that purportedly employ an alternative mechanism of initiation when cap-dependent translation is reduced during mitosis or stress conditions. A closer look is necessary because evidence cited in support of the internal initiation hypothesis is often flawed. When putative internal ribosome entry sequences (IRESs) are examined more carefully, they often turn out to harbor cryptic promoters or splice sites. This undermines the dicistronic assay, wherein IRES activity is measured by the ability to support translation of the 3' cistron. Most putative IRESs still have not been checked carefully to determine whether the dicistronic vector produces only the intended dicistronic mRNA. The widespread use of the pRF vector is a major problem because this vector, which has Renillaluciferase as the 5' cistron and firefly luciferase as the 3' cistron, has been found to generate spliced transcripts. RNA transfection assays could theoretically circumvent these problems, but most candidate IRESs score very weakly in that test. The practice of calling even very weak results 'positive' is one of the problems discussed herein. The extremely low efficiency of putative IRESs is inconsistent with their postulated biological roles. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background. The genus Alphavirus includes several potentially lethal human viruses. Additionally, species such as Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus are important vectors for gene therapy, vaccination and cancer research, and important models for virion assembly and structural analyses. The genome encodes nine known proteins, including the small '6K' protein. 6K appears to be involved in envelope protein processing, membrane permeabilization, virion assembly and virus budding. In protein gels, 6K migrates as a doublet - a result that, to date, has been attributed to differing degrees of acylation. Nonetheless, despite many years of research, its role is still relatively poorly understood. Results. We report that ribosomal -1 frameshifting, with an estimated efficiency of ∼10-18\%, occurs at a conserved UUUUUUA motif within the sequence encoding 6K, resulting in the synthesis of an additional protein, termed TF (TransFrame protein; ∼8 kDa), in which the C-terminal amino acids are encoded by the -1 frame. The presence of TF in the Semliki Forest virion was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The expression patterns of TF and 6K were studied by pulse-chase labelling, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, using both wild-type virus and a TF knockout mutant. We show that it is predominantly TF that is incorporated into the virion, not 6K as previously believed. Investigation of the 3' stimulatory signals responsible for efficient frameshifting at the UUUUUUA motif revealed a remarkable diversity of signals between different alphavirus species. Conclusion. Our results provide a surprising new explanation for the 6K doublet, demand a fundamental reinterpretation of existing data on the alphavirus 6K protein, and open the way for future progress in the further characterization of the 6K and TF proteins. The results have implications for alphavirus biology, virion structure, viroporins, ribosomal frameshifting, and bioinformatic identification of novel frameshift-expressed genes, both in viruses and in cellular organisms. © 2008 Firth et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Frameshifting is typically stimulated by signals contained within the mRNA: a 'slippery' sequence and a 3-adjacent RNA structure.

Here we analyzed PRF in the related Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). We show that 2A is also required for PRF in TMEV and can stimulate PRF to levels as high as 58\% in rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translations and 81\% during virus infection. We also show that TMEV 2A trans-activates PRF on the EMCV signal but not vice versa.

   abstract = { Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a member of the genus Cardiovirus in the Picornaviridae , a family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Previously, we demonstrated that in the related cardiovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus , a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) occurs at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence within the 2B-encoding region of the polyprotein open reading frame (ORF). Here we show that -1 PRF occurs at a similar site during translation of the TMEV genome. In addition, we demonstrate that a predicted 3' RNA stem-loop structure at a noncanonical spacing downstream of the shift site is required for efficient frameshifting in TMEV and that frameshifting also requires virus infection. Mutating the G_GUU_UUU shift site to inhibit frameshifting results in an attenuated virus with reduced growth kinetics and a small-plaque phenotype. Frameshifting in the virus context was found to be extremely efficient at 74 to 82\%, which, to our knowledge, is the highest frameshifting efficiency recorded to date for any virus. We propose that highly efficient -1 PRF in TMEV provides a mechanism to escape the confines of equimolar expression normally inherent in the single-polyprotein expression strategy of picornaviruses.  IMPORTANCE Many viruses utilize programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to produce different protein products at a defined ratio, or to translate overlapping ORFs to increase coding capacity. With few exceptions, -1 PRF occurs on specific “slippery” heptanucleotide sequences and is stimulated by RNA structure beginning 5 to 9 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the slippery site. Here we describe an unusual case of -1 PRF in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) that is extraordinarily efficient (74 to 82\% of ribosomes shift into the alternative reading frame) and, in stark contrast to other examples of -1 PRF, is dependent upon a stem-loop structure beginning 14 nt downstream of the slippery site. Furthermore, in TMEV-based reporter constructs in transfected cells, efficient frameshifting is critically dependent upon virus infection. We suggest that TMEV evolved frameshifting as a novel mechanism for removing ribosomes from the message (a “ribosome sink”) to downregulate synthesis of the 3'-encoded replication proteins. },

   abstract = {To ensure efficient propagation, viruses need to rapidly produce viral proteins after cell entrance. Since viral genomes do not encode any components of the protein biosynthesis machinery, viral proteins must be produced by the host cell. To hi-jack the host cellular translation, viruses use a great variety of distinct strategies. Many single-stranded positive-sensed RNA viruses contain so-called internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). IRESs are structural RNA motifs that have evolved to specific folds that recruit the host ribosomes on the viral coding sequences in order to synthesize viral proteins. In host canonical translation, recruitment of the translation machinery components is essentially guided by the 5' cap (m7G) of mRNA. In contrast, IRESs are able to promote efficient ribosome assembly internally and in cap-independent manner. IRESs have been categorized into four classes, based on their length, nucleotide sequence, secondary and tertiary structures, as well as their mode of action. Classes I and II require the assistance of cellular auxiliary factors, the eukaryotic intiation factors (eIF), for efficient ribosome assembly. Class III IRESs require only a subset of eIFs whereas Class IV, which are the more compact, can promote translation without any eIFs. Extensive functional and structural investigations of IRESs over the past decades have allowed a better understanding of their mode of action for viral translation. Because viral translation has a pivotal role in the infectious program, IRESs are therefore attractive targets for therapeutic purposes. WIREs RNA 2018, 9:e1458. doi: 10.1002/wrna.1458.

   abstract = {Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a protein implicated in diverse cellular functions, including exocytosis, DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. It was recently proposed to be involved in RNA metabolism because it was shown to associate with some cellular mRNA. Here, we identified ANXA2 as a RNA binding protein (RBP) that binds IBV (Infectious Bronchitis Virus) pseudoknot RNA. We first confirmed the binding of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA by ultraviolet crosslinking and showed its binding to RNA pseudoknot with ANXA2 protein in vitro and in the cells. Since the RNA pseudoknot located in the frameshifting region of IBV was used as bait for cellular RBPs, we tested whether ANXA2 could regulate the frameshfting of IBV pseudoknot RNA by dual luciferase assay. Overexpression of ANXA2 significantly reduced the frameshifting efficiency from IBV pseudoknot RNA and knockdown of the protein strikingly increased the frameshifting efficiency. The results suggest that ANXA2 is a cellular RBP that can modulate the frameshifting efficiency of viral RNA, enabling it to act as an anti-viral cellular protein, and hinting at roles in RNA metabolism for other cellular mRNAs.},

   abstract = {Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms, including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single mRNA transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work, we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during its biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results indicate that cotranslational folding of this viral protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent polypeptide chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding or binding events may also stimulate PRF.},

   abstract = {Messenger RNA encoded signals that are involved in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) are typically two-stemmed hairpin (H)-type pseudoknots (pks). We previously described an unusual three-stemmed pseudoknot from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) that stimulated -1 PRF. The conserved existence of a third stem-loop suggested an important hitherto unknown function. Here we present new information describing structure and function of the third stem of the SARS pseudoknot. We uncovered RNA dimerization through a palindromic sequence embedded in the SARS-CoV Stem 3. Further in vitro analysis revealed that SARS-CoV RNA dimers assemble through 'kissing' loop-loop interactions. We also show that loop-loop kissing complex formation becomes more efficient at physiological temperature and in the presence of magnesium. When the palindromic sequence was mutated, in vitro RNA dimerization was abolished, and frameshifting was reduced from 15 to 5.7\%. Furthermore, the inability to dimerize caused by the silent codon change in Stem 3 of SARS-CoV changed the viral growth kinetics and affected the levels of genomic and subgenomic RNA in infected cells. These results suggest that the homodimeric RNA complex formed by the SARS pseudoknot occurs in the cellular environment and that loop-loop kissing interactions involving Stem 3 modulate -1 PRF and play a role in subgenomic and full-length RNA synthesis. © The Author(s) 2013.},

   abstract = {Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a translational recoding mechanism that enables the synthesis of multiple polypeptides from a single transcript. During translation of the alphavirus structural polyprotein, the efficiency of -1PRF is coordinated by a 'slippery' sequence in the transcript, an adjacent RNA stem-loop, and a conformational transition in the nascent polypeptide chain. To characterize each of these effectors, we measured the effects of 4530 mutations on -1PRF by deep mutational scanning. While most mutations within the slip-site and stem-loop reduce the efficiency of -1PRF, the effects of mutations upstream of the slip-site are far more variable. We identify several regions where modifications of the amino acid sequence of the nascent polypeptide impact the efficiency of -1PRF. Molecular dynamics simulations of polyprotein biogenesis suggest the effects of these mutations primarily arise from their impacts on the mechanical forces that are generated by the translocon-mediated cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that the coupling between cotranslational folding and -1PRF depends on the translation kinetics upstream of the slip-site. These findings demonstrate how -1PRF is coordinated by features within both the transcript and nascent chain.},

Biochemical experiments validate the structural observations and reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence frameshifting efficiency.

However, temporal landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 translatome and its impact on the human genome remain unexplored. Here, we report a high-resolution atlas of the translatome and transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 for various time points after infecting human cells. Intriguingly, substantial amount of SARS-CoV-2 translation initiates at a novel translation initiation site (TIS) located in the leader sequence, termed TIS-L. Since TIS-L is included in all the genomic and subgenomic RNAs, the SARS-CoV-2 translatome may be regulated by a sophisticated interplay between TIS-L and downstream TISs. TIS-L functions as a strong translation enhancer for ORF S, and as translation suppressors for most of the other ORFs. Our global temporal atlas provides compelling insight into unique regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 translatome and helps comprehensively evaluate its impact on the human genome. Here, Kim et al. apply various sequencing techniques (RPF-seq, QTI-seq, mRNA-seq, sRNA-seq) to unravel the high-resolution, longitudinal translatome and transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2.

This genus includes four species as the taxonomic homes for equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), respectively. A revision of this classification is urgently needed to accommodate the recent description of eleven highly divergent simian arteriviruses in diverse African nonhuman primates, one novel arterivirus in an African forest giant pouched rat, and a novel arterivirus in common brushtails in New Zealand. In addition, the current arterivirus nomenclature is not in accordance with the most recent version of the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature. Here we outline an updated, amended, and improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data. Taxon-specific sequence cut-offs are established relying on a newly established open reading frame 1b phylogeny and pairwise sequence comparison (PASC) of coding-complete arterivirus genomes. As a result, the current genus Arterivirus is replaced by five genera: Equartevirus (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDV + PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFV + simian arteriviruses), Nesartevirus (for the arterivirus from forest giant pouched rats), and Dipartevirus (common brushtail arterivirus). The current species Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is divided into two species to accommodate the clear divergence of the European and American “types” of PRRSV, both of which now receive virus status. The current species Simian hemorrhagic fever virus is divided into nine species to accommodate the twelve known simian arteriviruses.

The NMR data are corroborated with secondary structure probing by DMS footprinting experiments. The close agreement of NMR secondary structure determination of isolated RNA elements with DMS footprinting and NMR performed on larger RNA regions shows that the secondary structure elements fold independently.

Stoichiometric NTD fully unwinds a TRS-cTRS duplex that mimics a transiently formed transcription intermediate in viral subgenomic RNA synthesis. Mutation of the solvent-exposed Y127, positioned on the β-platform surface of our 1.75 Å structure, binds the TRS far less tightly and is severely crippled in its RNA unwinding activity. In contrast, the C-terminal domain (CTD) exhibits no RNA unwinding activity. Viruses harboring Y127A N mutation are strongly selected against and Y127A N does not support an accessory function in MHV replication. We propose that the helix melting activity of the coronavirus N protein NTD plays a critical accessory role in subgenomic RNA synthesis and other processes requiring RNA remodeling. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Coronaviruses are large, enveloped RNA viruses of both medical and veterinary importance. Interest in this viral family has intensified in the past few years as a result of the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression. Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses. Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome. This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion assembly. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus outbreak in late 2002, early 2003 called attention to the potential damage that coronaviruses could cause in the human population. The ensuing research has enlightened many to the molecular biology of coronaviruses. A programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift is required by coronaviruses for the production of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase which in turn is essential for viral replication. The frameshifting signal encoded in the viral genome has additional features that are not essential for frameshifting. Elucidation of the differences between coronavirus frameshift signals and signals from other viruses may help our understanding of these features.

The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted during SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus life cycles remain ill defined. To address this gap, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens during infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). These screens uncovered host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) signaling, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as a requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VMP1, TMEM41, and TMEM64 (VTT) domain-containing protein transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses.

Frameshifting in SARS-CoV has been characterized in cultured mammalian cells using a dual luciferase reporter system and mass spectrometry. Mutagenic analysis of the SARS-CoV shift site and mass spectrometry of an affinity tagged frameshift product confirmed tandem tRNA slippage on the sequence U_UUA_AAC. Analysis of the downstream pseudoknot stimulator of frameshifting in SARS-CoV shows that a proposed RNA secondary structure in loop II and two unpaired nucleotides at the stem I-stem II junction in SARS-CoV are important for frameshift stimulation.

   abstract = {Programmed - 1 ribosomal frameshifting is necessary for translation of the polymerase genes of many viruses. In addition to the consensus elements in the mRNA around the frameshift site, we found previously that frameshifting on Barley yellow dwarf virus RNA requires viral sequence located four kilobases downstream. By using dual luciferase reporter constructs, we now show that a predicted loop in the far downstream frameshift element must base pair to a bulge in a bulged stem loop adjacent to the frameshift site. Introduction of either two or six base mismatches in either the bulge or the far downstream loop abolished frame-shifting, whereas mutations in both sites that restored base pairing reestablished frameshifting. Likewise, disruption of this base pairing abolished viral RNA replication in plant cells, and restoration of base pairing completely reestablished virus replication. We propose a model in which Barley yellow dwarf virus uses this and another long-distance base-pairing event required for cap-independent translation to allow the replicase copying from the 3' end to shut off translation of upstream ORFs and free the RNA of ribosomes to allow unimpeded replication. This would be a means of solving the "problem," common to positive strand RNA viruses, of competition between ribosomes and replicase for the same RNA template.},

However, many RNA virus transcripts have marked structural differences from cellular mRNAs that preclude canonical translation initiation, such as the absence of a 59 cap structure or the presence of highly structured 59UTRs containing replication and/or packaging signals. Furthermore, whilst the great majority of cellular mRNAs are apparently monocistronic, RNA viruses must often express multiple proteins from their mRNAs. In addition, RNA viruses have very compact genomes and are under intense selective pressure to optimize usage of the available sequence space. Together, these features have driven the evolution of a plethora of non-canonical translational mechanisms in RNA viruses that help them to meet these challenges. Here, we review the mechanisms utilized by RNA viruses of eukaryotes, focusing on internal ribosome entry, leakyscanning, non-AUG initiation, ribosome shunting, reinitiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stopcodon readthrough.

   abstract = {The 5.8 kb RNA genome of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF2a and ORF2b, which are characterized by helicase and RNA polymerase motifs, respectively, and possibly represent the viral replicase. Within the overlap, ORF2b lacks an AUG translational start codon and is therefore presumably translated by - 1 ribosomal frameshifting as a transframe protein with ORF2a. This hypothesis was studied by introducing the putative frameshift region into an internal position of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and testing for the occurrence of frameshifting in vivo by transient expression of GUS activity in potato protoplasts as well as in vitro by translation in the reticulocyte system. Both experimental approaches demonstrate that a - 1 frameshift occurs at a frequency of ~1\%. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the frameshift region and the involvement of the novel heptanucleotide motif UUUAAAU in conjunction with an adjacent stem-loop structure. Part of this stem-loop encodes a basic region in the ORF2b moiety of the transframe protein which was shown by binding experiments with PLRV RNA to represent a nucleic acid-binding domain. These data support a possible biological significance of the frameshift to occur at this position of the large overlap by including the putative RNA template-binding site of the PLRV replicase in the ORF2a/ORF2b transframe protein.},

   abstract = {The genus Cardiovirus (family Picornaviridae) currently comprises the species Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Theilovirus. Cardioviruses have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that encodes a large polyprotein (L-1ABCD-2ABC-3ABCD) that is cleaved to produce approximately 12 mature proteins. We report on a conserved ORF that overlaps the 2B-encoding sequence of EMCV in the +2 reading frame. The ORF is translated as a 128-129 amino acid transframe fusion (2B*) with the N-terminal 11-12 amino acids of 2B, via ribosomal frameshifting at a conserved GGUUUUY motif. Mutations that knock out expression of 2B*result in a small-plaque phenotype. Curiously, although theilovirus sequences lack a long ORF in the +2 frame at this genomic location, they maintain a conserved GGUUUUU motif just downstream of the 2A-2B junction, and a highly localized peak in conservation at polyprotein-frame synonymous sites suggests that theiloviruses also utilize frameshifting here, albeit into a very short +2-frame ORF.

   abstract = {The rapid spread and potential link with birth defects have made Zika virus (ZIKV) a global public health problem. The virus was discovered 70 years ago, yet the knowledge about its genomic structure and the genetic variations associated with current ZIKV explosive epidemics remains not fully understood. In this review, the genome organization, especially conserved terminal structures of ZIKV genome were characterized and compared with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. It is suggested that major viral proteins of ZIKV share high structural and functional similarity with other known flaviviruses as shown by sequence comparison and prediction of functional motifs in viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all ZIKV strains circulating in the America form a unique clade within the Asian lineage. Furthermore, we identified a series of conserved amino acid residues that differentiate the Asian strains including the current circulating American strains from the ancient African strains. Overall, our findings provide an overview of ZIKV genome characterization and evolutionary dynamics in the Americas and point out critical clues for future virological and epidemiological studies.},

   abstract = {Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Usutu and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses form a tight subgroup within the larger Flavivirus genus. These viruses utilize a single-polyprotein expression strategy, resulting in ∼10 mature proteins. Plotting the conservation at synonymous sites along the polyprotein coding sequence reveals strong conservation peaks at the very 5' end of the coding sequence, and also at the 5' end of the sequence encoding the NS2A protein. Such peaks are generally indicative of functionally important non-coding sequence elements. The second peak corresponds to a predicted stable pseudoknot structure whose biological importance is supported by compensatory mutations that preserve the structure. The pseudoknot is preceded by a conserved slippery heptanucleotide (Y CCU UUU), thus forming a classical stimulatory motif for -1 ribosomal frameshifting. We hypothesize, therefore, that the functional importance of the pseudoknot is to stimulate a portion of ribosomes to shift -1 nt into a short (45 codon), conserved, overlapping open reading frame, termed foo. Since cleavage at the NS1-NS2A boundary is known to require synthesis of NS2A in cis, the resulting transframe fusion protein is predicted to be NS1-NS2AN-term-FOO. We hypothesize that this may explain the origin of the previously identified NS1 'extension' protein in JEV-group flaviviruses, known as NS1'. © 2009 Firth and Atkins; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The corresponding OPV proteins comprise those known to be essential for replication as well as many that are still uncharacterized, including 2 of less than 60 amino acids that had not been previously noted The OPV proteins most highly conserved in MCV are involved in transcription; the least conserved include membrane glycoproteins. Twenty of the MOV proteins with OPV counterparts also have cellular homologs and additional MCV proteins have conserved functional motifs. Of the 77 predicted MCV proteins without OPV counterparts, 10 have similarity to other MOV proteins and/or distant similarity to proteins of other poxviruses and 16 have cellular homologs including some predicted to antagonize host defenses. Clustering poxvirus proteins by sequence similarity revealed 3 unique MCV gene families and 8 families that are conserved in MCV and OPV. Two unique families contain putative membrane receptors; the third includes 2 proteins, each containing 2 DED apoptosis signal transduction domains. Additional families with conserved patterns of cysteines and putative redox active centers were identified. Promoters, transcription termination signals, and DNA concatemer resolution sequences are highly conserved in MCV and OPV. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that MCV, OPV, and leporipoxviruses radiated from a common poxvirus ancestor after the divergence of avipoxviruses. Despite the acquisition of unique genes for host interactions and changes in GO content, the physical order and regulation of essential ancestral poxvirus genes have been largely conserved in MCV and OPV.},

   abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are frequently produced during viral infections. Generation of these ROS can be both beneficial and detrimental for many cellular functions. When overwhelming the antioxidant defense system, the excess of ROS induces oxidative stress. Viral infections lead to diseases characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, with oxidative stress being one of their hallmarks. In many cases, ROS can, in turn, enhance viral replication leading to an amplification loop. Another important parameter for viral replication and pathogenicity is the nutritional status of the host. Viral infection simultaneously increases the demand for micronutrients and causes their loss, which leads to a deficiency that can be compensated by micronutrient supplementation. Among the nutrients implicated in viral infection, selenium (Se) has an important role in antioxidant defense, redox signaling and redox homeostasis. Most of biological activities of selenium is performed through its incorporation as a rare amino acid selenocysteine in the essential family of selenoproteins. Selenium deficiency, which is the main regulator of selenoprotein expression, has been associated with the pathogenicity of several viruses. In addition, several selenoprotein members, including glutathione peroxidases (GPX), thioredoxin reductases (TXNRD) seemed important in different models of viral replication. Finally, the formal identification of viral selenoproteins in the genome of molluscum contagiosum and fowlpox viruses demonstrated the importance of selenoproteins in viral cycle.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 has exploded throughout the human population. To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the local RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data. All results are made available via a public database (the RNAStructuromeDB: https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2) and model comparisons are readily viewable at https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2-global-model-comparisons.},

   abstract = {The RNA pseudoknot that stimulates programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2 is a possible drug target. To understand how it responds to mechanical tension applied by ribosomes, thought to play a key role during frameshifting, we probe its structural dynamics using optical tweezers. We find that it forms multiple structures: two pseudoknotted conformers with different stability and barriers, and alternative stem-loop structures. The pseudoknotted conformers have distinct topologies, one threading the 5' end through a 3-helix junction to create a knot-like fold, the other with unthreaded 5' end, consistent with structures observed via cryo-EM and simulations. Refolding of the pseudoknotted conformers starts with stem 1, followed by stem 3 and lastly stem 2; Mg2+ ions are not required, but increase pseudoknot mechanical rigidity and favor formation of the knot-like conformer. These results resolve the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signal folding mechanism and highlight its conformational heterogeneity, with important implications for structure-based drug-discovery efforts. The RNA pseudoknot of SARS-CoV-2 promotes -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Here the authors use single molecule force spectroscopy to study the folding of this pseudoknot, showing that it forms at least two different pseudoknot conformers with distinct fold topologies.},

Furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli and Candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho- p -toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3\% to 86.8\% for the E. coli sequence by using modification constraints. For C. albicans , the accuracy remained 87.5\% both with and without modification data. On average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67\% to 76\%. This enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with <40\% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28\% to 78\%. For the 11 sequences with <6\% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84\% of known canonical base pairs.},

The zinc-finger of U1-C interacts with the duplex between pre-mRNA and the 5'-end of U1 snRNA. The binding of the RNA duplex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between U1-C and the RNA backbone around the splice junction but U1-C makes no base-specific contacts with pre-mRNA. The structure, together with RNA binding assays, shows that the selection of 5'-splice site nucleotides by U1 snRNP is achieved predominantly through basepairing with U1 snRNA whilst U1-C fine-tunes relative affinities of mismatched 5'-splice sites.},

Here we describe an efficient NMR-SAXS/WAXS approach for structural investigation of multi-helical RNAs. We illustrate this approach by determining the overall fold of a 92-nt 3-helix junction from the U4/U6 di-snRNA. The U4/U6 di-snRNA is conserved in eukaryotes and is part of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that comprises a major subunit of the assembled spliceosome. Helical orientations can be determined by X-ray scattering data alone, but the addition of NMR RDC (residual dipolar coupling) restraints improves the structure models. RDCs were measured in two different external alignment media and also by magnetic susceptibility anisotropy. The resulting alignment tensors are collinear, which is a previously noted problem for nucleic acids. Including WAXS data in the calculations produces models with significantly better fits to the scattering data. In solution, the U4/U6 di-snRNA forms a 3-helix junction with a planar Y-shaped structure and has no detectable tertiary interactions. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer data support the observed topology. A comparison with the recently determined cryo-electron microscopy structure of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP illustrates how proteins scaffold the RNA and dramatically alter the geometry of the U4/U6 3-helix junction.},

Here, we investigate the RNA structure and RNA-RNA interactions of wildtype (WT) and a mutant (Δ382) SARS-CoV-2 in cells using Illumina and Nanopore platforms. We identify twelve potentially functional structural elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, observe that subgenomic RNAs can form different structures, and that WT and Δ382 virus genomes fold differently. Proximity ligation sequencing identify hundreds of RNA-RNA interactions within the virus genome and between the virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 genome binds strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 2’-O-methylated. 2’-O-methylation sites are enriched in viral untranslated regions, associated with increased virus pair-wise interactions, and are decreased in host mRNAs upon virus infection, suggesting that the virus sequesters methylation machinery from host RNAs towards its genome. These studies deepen our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and provide a platform for targeted therapy.},

   abstract = {The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered an excellent target for COVID-19 antiviral drug development because it is essential for viral replication and has a cleavage specificity distinct from human proteases. However, drug development for 3CLpro has been hindered by a lack of cell-based reporter assays that can be performed in a BSL-2 setting. Current efforts to identify 3CLpro inhibitors largely rely upon in vitro screening, which fails to account for cell permeability and cytotoxicity of compounds, or assays involving replication-competent virus, which must be performed in a BSL-3 facility. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel cell-based luciferase complementation reporter assay to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a BSL-2 setting. The assay is based on a lentiviral vector that co-expresses 3CLpro and two luciferase fragments linked together by a 3CLpro cleavage site. 3CLpro-mediated cleavage results in a loss of complementation and low luciferase activity, whereas inhibition of 3CLpro results in 10-fold higher levels of luciferase activity. The luciferase reporter assay can easily distinguish true 3CLpro inhibition from cytotoxicity, a powerful feature that should reduce false positives during screening. Using the assay, we screened 32 small molecules for activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, including HIV protease inhibitors, HCV protease inhibitors, and various other compounds that have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Of these, only five exhibited significant inhibition of 3CLpro in cells: GC376, boceprevir, Z-FA-FMK, calpain inhibitor XII, and GRL-0496. This assay should greatly facilitate efforts to identify more potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.},

   abstract = {Background: Hamburg is a city state of approximately 1.9 Mio inhabitants in Northern Germany. Currently, the COVID-19 epidemic that had largely subsided during last summer is resurging in Hamburg and in other parts of the world, underlining the need for additional tools to monitor SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Aim: We aimed to develop and validate a simple, low-cost assay for detecting antibodies against the native coronavirus 2 spike protein (CoV-2 S) that does not require recombinant protein or virus. Method: We transiently co-transfected HEK cells or CHO cells with expression vectors encoding CoV-2 S and nuclear GFP. Spike protein-specific antibodies in human serum samples bound to transfected cells were detected with fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies by flow cytometry orimmunofluorescence microscopy. We applied this assay to monitor antibody development in COVID-19 patients, household contacts, and hospital personnel during the ongoing epidemic in the city state of Hamburg. Results: All recovered COVID-19 patients showed high levels of CoV-2 S-specific antibodies. With one exception, all household members that did not develop symptoms also did not develop detectable antibodies. Similarly, lab personnel that worked during the epidemic and followed social distancing guidelines remained antibody-negative. Conclusion: We conclude that high-titer CoV-2 S-specific antibodies are found in most recovered COVID-19 patients and in symptomatic contacts, but only rarely in asymptomatic contacts. The assay may help health care providers to monitor disease progression and antibody responses in vaccination trials, to identify health care personnel that likely are resistant to re-infection, and recovered individuals with high antibody titers that may be suitable asplasma and/or antibody donors.},

   abstract = {Among RNA viruses, the order Nidovirales stands out for including viruses with the largest RNA genomes currently known. Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were clearly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated at all, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.},

We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2’s entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2’s ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species, together with frequent recombination among coronaviruses, suggests a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.},

Yin et al. focused on the viral polymerase essential for replicating viral RNA. They determined a structure of the polymerase bound to RNA and to the drug remdesivir. Remdesivir mimics an RNA nucleotide building block and is covalently linked to the replicating RNA, which blocks further synthesis of RNA. The structure provides a template for designing improved therapeutics against the viral polymerase.

Science , this issue p. [1499][1]

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global crisis. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme, a target of the antiviral drug remdesivir. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, both in the apo form at 2.8-angstrom resolution and in complex with a 50-base template-primer RNA and remdesivir at 2.5-angstrom resolution. The complex structure reveals that the partial double-stranded RNA template is inserted into the central channel of the RdRp, where remdesivir is covalently incorporated into the primer strand at the first replicated base pair, and terminates chain elongation. Our structures provide insights into the mechanism of viral RNA replication and a rational template for drug design to combat the viral infection.

We further identified seven of these 19 genes, including two known cell division genes, ftsZ and sepF, a hydrolase of unknown substrate, and four genes that encode membrane-associated proteins of unknown function, which are required together to restore a phenotype similar to that of JCVI-syn1.0.

We have named these transcriptive intermediates (TIs) and native transcriptive forms (TFs) because they are not replicating genome-sized RNA. Based on solubility in high salt solutions, approximately 70\% of the replicating and transcribing structures that accumulated in infected cells by 5–6 h post-infection were multi-stranded intermediates, the RI/TIs. The other 30\% were in double-stranded structures, the native RF/TFs. These replicating and transcribing structures were separated by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients or by gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose 2B and Sephacryl S-1000, and migrated on agarose gels during electrophoresis, according to their size. Digestion with RNase T1 at 1–10 units/μg RNA resolved RI/TIs into RF/TF cores and left native RF/TFs intact, whereas RNase A at concentrations of 0·02 μg/μg RNA or higher degraded both native RF/TFs and RI/TIs. Viral RI/TIs and native RF/TFs bound to magnetic beads containing oligo(dT)25, suggesting that the poly(A) sequence on the 3' end of the positive strands was longer than any poly(U) on the negative strands. Kinetics of incorporation of [3H]uridine showed that both the RI and TIs were transcriptionally active and the labelling of RI/TIs was not the dead-end product of aberrant negative-strand synthesis. Failure originally to find TIs and TF cores was probably due to overdigestion with RNase A.},

   abstract = { The generation of subgenomic mRNAs in coronavirus involves a discontinuous mechanism of transcription by which the common leader sequence, derived from the genome 5' terminus, is fused to the 5' end of the mRNA coding sequence (body). Transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) precede each gene and include a conserved core sequence (CS) surrounded by relatively variable sequences (5' TRS and 3' TRS). Regulation of transcription in coronaviruses has been studied by reverse-genetics analysis of the sequences immediately flanking a unique CS in the Transmissible gastroenteritis virus genome (CS-S2), located inside the S gene, that does not lead to detectable amounts of the corresponding mRNA, in spite of its canonical sequence. The transcriptional inactivity of CS-S2 was genome position independent. The presence of a canonical CS was not sufficient to drive transcription, but subgenomic synthesis requires a minimum base pairing between the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complement of the body TRS (cTRS-B) provided by the CS and its adjacent nucleotides. A good correlation was observed between the free energy of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation and the levels of subgenomic mRNA S2, demonstrating that base pairing between the leader and body beyond the CS is a determinant regulation factor in coronavirus transcription. In TRS mutants with increasing complementarity between TRS-L and cTRS-B, a tendency to reach a plateau in Δ G values was observed, suggesting that a more precise definition of the TRS limits might be proposed, specifically that it consists of the central CS and around 4 nucleotides flanking 5' and 3' the CS. Sequences downstream of the CS exert a stronger influence on the template-switching decision according to a model of polymerase strand transfer and template switching during minus-strand synthesis. },

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious respiratory virus causing adult atypical pneumonia COVID-19 with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (+RNA) genome of ~ 29.9 kb and exhibits significant genetic shift from different isolates. After entering the susceptible cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly functions as an mRNA to translate two polyproteins from the ORF1a and ORF1b region, which are cleaved by two viral proteases into sixteen non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) to initiate viral genome replication and transcription. The SARS-CoV-2 genome also encodes four structural (S, E, M and N) and up to six accessory (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 9b) proteins, but their translation requires newly synthesized individual subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) in the infected cells. Synthesis of the full-length viral genomic RNA (gRNA) and sgRNAs are conducted inside double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) by the viral replication and transcription complex (RTC), which comprises nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and a short RNA primer. To produce sgRNAs, RTC starts RNA synthesis from the highly structured gRNA 3' end and switches template at various transcription regulatory sequence (TRSB) sites along the gRNA body probably mediated by a long-distance RNA–RNA interaction. The TRS motif in the gRNA 5' leader (TRSL) is responsible for the RNA–RNA interaction with the TRSB upstream of each ORF and skipping of the viral genome in between them to produce individual sgRNAs. Abundance of individual sgRNAs and viral gRNA synthesized in the infected cells depend on the location and read-through efficiency of each TRSB. Although more studies are needed, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has taught the world a painful lesson that is to invest and proactively prepare future emergence of other types of coronaviruses and any other possible biological horrors.},

In SARS CoV-infected cells, 10 sgRNAs, including 2 novel ones, were identified, which were predicted to be functional in the expression of 12 open reading frames located in the 3' one-third of the genome. Surprisingly, one new sgRNA could lead to production of a truncated spike protein. Sequence analysis of the leader-body fusion sites of each sgRNA showed that the junction sequences and the corresponding transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS) are unique for each species of sgRNA and are consistent after virus passages. For the two novel sgRNAs, each used a variant of the TRS that has one nucleotide mismatch in the conserved hexanucleotide core (ACGAAC) in the TRS. Coexistence of both plus and minus strands of SARS CoV sgRNAs and evidence for derivation of the sgRNA core sequence from the body core sequence favor the model of discontinuous transcription during minus-strand synthesis. Moreover, one rare species of sgRNA has the junction sequence AAA, indicating that its transcription could result from a noncanonical transcription signal. Taken together, these results provide more insight into the molecular mechanisms of genome expression and subgenomic transcription of SARS CoV.},

Several coronaviruses have an ORF located between the N gene and the 3'-UTR, an area previously thought to be non-coding in the Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) due to a lack of a canonical TRS-B. Here, we identify a non-canonical TRS-B allowing for a novel sgmRNA relating to this ORF to be produced in several strains of IBV: Beaudette, CR88, H120, D1466, Italy-02 and QX. Interestingly, the potential protein produced by this ORF is prematurely truncated in the Beaudette strain. A single nucleotide deletion was made in the Beaudette strain allowing for the generation of a recombinant IBV (rIBV) that had the potential to express a full-length protein. Assessment of this rIBV in vitro demonstrated that restoration of the full-length potential protein had no effect on viral replication. Further assessment of the Beaudette-derived RNA identified a second non-canonically transcribed sgmRNA located within gene 2.

   abstract = {Combinatorial CRISPR screens are improved by using Cas9 enzymes from two different organisms. Combinatorial genetic screening using CRISPR–Cas9 is a useful approach to uncover redundant genes and to explore complex gene networks. However, current methods suffer from interference between the single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and from limited gene targeting activity. To increase the efficiency of combinatorial screening, we employ orthogonal Cas9 enzymes from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. We used machine learning to establish S. aureus Cas9 sgRNA design rules and paired S. aureus Cas9 with S. pyogenes Cas9 to achieve dual targeting in a high fraction of cells. We also developed a lentiviral vector and cloning strategy to generate high-complexity pooled dual-knockout libraries to identify synthetic lethal and buffering gene pairs across multiple cell types, including MAPK pathway genes and apoptotic genes. Our orthologous approach also enabled a screen combining gene knockouts with transcriptional activation, which revealed genetic interactions with TP53. The “Big Papi” (paired aureus and pyogenes for interactions) approach described here will be widely applicable for the study of combinatorial phenotypes.},

Here, we develop a method for controlling gene expression based on Cas9, an RNA-γuided DNA endonuclease from a type II CRISPR system. We show that a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide RNA, generates a DNA recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, RNA polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding. This system, which we call CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. CRISPRi can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells.

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) polyproteins incorporate 16 protein domains (nsps), with nsp1 and nsp2 being the most variable among the coronaviruses and having no experimentally confirmed or predicted functions in replication. To determine if nsp2 is essential for viral replication, MHV and SARS-CoV genome RNA was generated with deletions of the nsp2 coding sequence (MHVΔnsp2 and SARSΔnsp2, respectively). Infectious MHVΔnsp2 and SARSΔnsp2 viruses recovered from electroporated cells had 0.5 to 1 log 10 reductions in peak titers in single-cycle growth assays, as well as a reduction in viral RNA synthesis that was not specific for any positive-stranded RNA species. The Δnsp2 mutant viruses lacked expression of both nsp2 and an nsp2-nsp3 precursor, but cleaved the engineered chimeric nsp1-nsp3 cleavage site as efficiently as the native nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site. Replication complexes in MHVΔnsp2-infected cells lacked nsp2 but were morphologically indistinguishable from those of wild-type MHV by immunofluorescence. nsp2 expressed in cells by stable retroviral transduction was specifically recruited to viral replication complexes upon infection with MHVΔnsp2. These results demonstrate that while nsp2 of MHV and SARS-CoV is dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, deletion of the nsp2 coding sequence attenuates viral growth and RNA synthesis. These findings also provide a system for the study of determinants of nsp targeting and function. },

   abstract = {The replication of coronaviruses occurs in association with multiple virus-induced membrane structures that evolve during the course of infection; however, the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. Previous studies of coronavirus replication complex organization and protein interactions have utilized protein overexpression studies and immunofluorescence of fixed cells. Additionally, live-imaging studies of coronavirus replicase proteins have used fluorescent reporter molecules fused to replicase proteins, but expressed from nonnative locations, mostly late-transcribed subgenomic mRNAs, in the presence or absence of the native protein. Thus, the timing and targeting of native replicase proteins expressed in real time from native locations in the genome remain unknown. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules could be expressed from the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural protein 2 or 3 and whether such reporters could define the targeting and activity of replicase proteins during infection. We demonstrate that the fusion of green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase with either nonstructural protein 2 or 3 is tolerated and that these reporter-replicase fusions can be used to quantitate replication complex formation and virus replication. The results show that the replicase gene has flexibility to accommodate a foreign gene addition and can be used directly to study replicase complex formation and evolution during infection as well as to provide highly sensitive and specific markers for protein translation and genome replication. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

Whether or not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to liver damage per se remains unknown. Herein, we reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with liver enzyme abnormalities. Methods: We analyzed 156 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from 2 designated centers in China and compared clinical features between patients with or without elevated aminotransferases. Postmortem liver biopsies were obtained from 2 cases who had elevated aminotransferases. We investigated the patterns of liver impairment by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay and pathological studies. Results: Sixty-four out of 156 (41.0\%) patients with COVID-19 had elevated aminotransferases. The median levels of alanine aminotransferase were 50 U/L vs. 19 U/L, respectively, aspartate aminotransferase were 45.5 U/L vs. 24 U/L, respectively in abnormal and normal aminotransferase groups. Liver enzyme abnormalities were associated with disease severity, as well as a series of laboratory tests including higher alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference, higher gamma-glutamyltransferase, lower albumin, decreased CD4+ T cells and B lymphocytes. Ultrastructural examination identified typical coronavirus particles, characterized by spike structures, in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in 2 COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2-infected hepatocytes displayed conspicuous mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation and glycogen granule decrease. Histologically, massive hepatic apoptosis and some binuclear hepatocytes were observed. Taken together, both ultrastructural and histological evidence indicated a typical lesion of viral infection. Immunohistochemical results showed scarce CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. No obvious eosinophil infiltration, cholestasis, fibrin deposition, granuloma, massive central necrosis, or interface hepatitis were observed. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the liver directly contributes to hepatic impairment in patients with COVID-19. Hence, a surveillance of viral clearance in liver and long-term outcome of COVID-19 is required. Lay summary: Liver enzyme abnormalities are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with elevated liver enzymes. Our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the liver is a crucial factor contributing to hepatic impairment in patients with COVID-19.},

They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections, and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other +RNA viruses, coronaviruses have an exceptionally large genome and employ a complex genome expression strategy. Next to a role in basic virus replication or virus assembly, many of the coronavirus proteins expressed in the infected cell contribute to the coronavirus-host interplay. For example, by interacting with the host cell to create an optimal environment for coronavirus replication, by altering host gene expression or by counteracting the host’s antiviral defenses. These coronavirus–host interactions are key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine the outcome of infection. Due to the complexity of the coronavirus proteome and replication cycle, our knowledge of host factors involved in coronavirus replication is still in an early stage compared to what is known for some other +RNA viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of coronavirus–host interactions at the level of the infected cell, with special attention for the assembly and function of the viral RNA-synthesising machinery and the evasion of cellular innate immune responses.},

Replicon, a non-infectious self-replicative viral RNA, could be a safe and effective tool for antiviral evaluation. Herein, we generated a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Eight fragments covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome except S, E, and M genes were amplified with HiBiT-tag sequence by PCR. The amplicons were ligated and in vitro transcribed to RNA. The cells electroporated with the replicon RNA showed more than 3000 times higher luminescence than MOCK control cells at 24 h post-electroporation, indicating robust translation and RNA replication of the replicon. The replication was drastically inhibited by remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. The IC50 of remdesivir in this study was 0.29 μM, generally consistent to the IC50 obtained using infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a previous study (0.77 μM). Taken together, this system could be applied to the safe and effective antiviral evaluation without using infectious SARS-CoV-2.

To overcome these limitations, we engineered a SARS-CoV-2 replicon, which is a modified virus subgenome capable of self-replicating without producing infectious virus, allowing the viral replication to be studied in a conventional biomedical laboratory setting. The replicon system also provides a valuable tool to screen and test antiviral compounds in biologically relevant cells.

   abstract = {Arteri-, corona-, toro- and roniviruses are evolutionarily related positive-strand RNA viruses, united in the order Nidovirales. The best studied nidoviruses, the corona- and arteriviruses, employ a unique transcription mechanism, which involves discontinuous RNA synthesis, a process resembling similarity-assisted copy-choice RNA recombination. During infection, multiple subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are transcribed from a mirror set of sg negative-strand RNA templates. The sg mRNAs all possess a short 5' common leader sequence, derived from the 5' end of the genomic RNA. The joining of the non-contiguous 'leader' and 'body' sequences presumably occurs during minus-strand synthesis. To study whether toroviruses use a similar transcription mechanism, we characterized the 5' termini of the genome and the four sg mRNAs of Berne virus (BEV). We show that BEV mRNAs 3-5 lack a leader sequence. Surprisingly, however, RNA 2 does contain a leader, identical to the 5'-terminal 18 residues of the genome. Apparently, BEV combines discontinuous and non-discontinous RNA synthesis to produce its sg mRNAs. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the mechanism and evolution of nidovirus transcription.},

   abstract = {RNA-RNA recombination is thought to occur preferentially at certain selected sites and in only a few RNA viruses; the mechanism for these restrictions is unknown. In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported "hot spot" for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational "hot spots" for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses. This approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses. © 1991.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus whose success as a pathogen relies on its abilities to repurpose host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and to evade antiviral RBPs. To uncover the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome, we here develop a robust ribonucleoprotein (RNP) capture protocol and identify 109 host factors that directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Applying RNP capture on another coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between coronaviral RNAs and host proteins. Transcriptome analyses and knockdown experiments delineated 17 antiviral RBPs, including ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, PARP12, and SHFL, and 8 proviral RBPs, such as EIF3D and CSDE1, which are responsible for co-opting multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle. This also led to the identification of LARP1, a downstream target of the mTOR signaling pathway, as an antiviral host factor that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive list of RBPs regulating coronaviral replication and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of a pandemic with growing global mortality. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during active infection. Integration of this data with ChIRP-MS data from three other RNA viruses defined viral specificity of RNA-host protein interactions. Targeted CRISPR screens revealed that the majority of functional RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and comparative CRISPR screens across seven RNA viruses revealed shared and SARS-specific antiviral factors. Finally, by combining the RNA-centric approach and functional CRISPR screens, we demonstrated a physical and functional connection between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondria, highlighting this organelle as a general platform for antiviral activity. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive catalog of functional SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, which may inform studies to understand the host-virus interface and nominate host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.},

   abstract = {This chapter briefly overviews some of the recent advancements and challenges in nidovirus research concerning the genetic diversity of nidoviruses and selected aspects of nidovirus classification and evolution. Although being nidovirus-wide in scope, most of the discussion concerns coronaviruses, which have been characterized most extensively. The chapter has benefited from a recently published review to which the reader is referred, for details concerning protein domains and the molecular biology of nidoviruses. The genomes of nidoviruses include untranslated regions at their genome termini. These flank an array of multiple genes whose number may vary in and among the families of the order Nidovirales. As in other organisms, two evolutionary mechanisms—mutation and recombination—have been implicated in the generation of nidovirus genome diversity and the maintenance of genome stability. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the parameters of nidovirus adaptability may result in the identification of the driving forces that have shaped nidovirus evolution. In this context, it will be essential to continue the sampling of the natural diversity of nidoviruses, also to see whether the genome size gap between the small and large nidoviruses will be filled with viruses with intermediate-size genomes, and whether nidoviruses infecting other phyla, e.g., plants and insects, can be identified. Ultimately, we may hope to learn whether the large nidoviruses have reached the theoretical genome size limit that nature may have set for RNA viruses. Finally, our progress in understanding the fundamental aspects of RNA virus genome expansion may help to monitor and control infections caused by nidoviruses.},

   abstract = {MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutants, representing one RNA+ and five RNA- complementation groups, were isolated and characterized by genetic recombination techniques. Maximum recombination frequencies occurred under multiplicities of infection greater than 10 each in which 99.99\% of the cells were co-infected. Recombination frequencies between different is mutants increased steadily during infection and peaked late in the virus growth cycle. These data suggest that recombination is a late event in the virus replication cycle. Recombination frequencies were also found to range from 63 to 20,000 times higher than the sum of the spontaneous reversion frequencies of each is mutant used in the cross. Utilizing standard genetic recombination techniques, the five RNA- complementation groups of MHV-A59 were arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map located at the 5' end of the genome in the 23-kb polymerase region. These data indicate that at least five distinct functions are encoded in the MHV polymerase region which function in virus transcription. Moreover, using well-characterized is mutants the recombination frequency for the entire 32-kb MHV genome was found to approach 25\% or more. This is the highest recombination frequency described for a nonsegmented, linear, plus-polarity RNA virus. © 1990.},

   abstract = {Coronaviruses have large positive-strand RNA genomes that are 5' capped and 3' polyadenylated. The 5'-terminal two-thirds of the genome contain two open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, that together make up the viral replicase gene and encode two large polyproteins that are processed by viral proteases into 15–16 nonstructural proteins, most of them being involved in viral RNA synthesis. ORFs located in the 3'-terminal one-third of the genome encode structural and accessory proteins and are expressed from a set of 5' leader-containing subgenomic mRNAs that are synthesized by a process called discontinuous transcription. Coronavirus protein synthesis not only involves cap-dependent translation mechanisms but also employs regulatory mechanisms, such as ribosomal frameshifting. Coronavirus replication is known to affect cellular translation, involving activation of stress-induced signaling pathways, and employing viral proteins that affect cellular mRNA translation and RNA stability. This chapter describes our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in coronavirus mRNA translation and changes in host mRNA translation observed in coronavirus-infected cells.},

   abstract = {Bacterial mRNAs are organized into operons consisting of discrete open reading frames (ORFs) in a single polycistronic mRNA. Individual ORFs on the mRNA are differentially translated, with rates varying as much as 100-fold. The signals controlling differential translation are poorly understood. Our genome-wide mRNA secondary structure analysis indicated that operonic mRNAs are comprised of ORF-wide units of secondary structure that vary across ORF boundaries such that adjacent ORFs on the same mRNA molecule are structurally distinct. ORF translation rate is strongly correlated with its mRNA structure in vivo, and correlation persists, albeit in a reduced form, with its structure when translation is inhibited and with that of in vitro refolded mRNA. These data suggest that intrinsic ORF mRNA structure encodes a rough blueprint for translation efficiency. This structure is then amplified by translation, in a self-reinforcing loop, to provide the structure that ultimately specifies the translation of each ORF.},

   abstract = {A large variety of RNA viruses, including the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, contain specific RNA structures that promote programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) to regulate viral gene expression. From a high-throughput compound screen, we identified a PRF inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 and found that it substantially impeded viral replication in cultured cells. Interestingly, the compound could target not only SARS-CoV-2 but also other coronaviruses that use similar RNA structures to promote frameshifting. These results suggest targeting PRF is a plausible, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral strategy for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to end until there is global roll-out of vaccines that protect against severe disease and preferably drive herd immunity. Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021. Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications. To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low-income and middle-income countries. We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes. Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We also present original data from a 32-country survey (n=26 758) on potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, conducted from October to December, 2020. Vaccine acceptance was highest in Vietnam (98\%), India (91\%), China (91\%), Denmark (87\%), and South Korea (87\%), and lowest in Serbia (38\%), Croatia (41\%), France (44\%), Lebanon (44\%), and Paraguay (51\%).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only. RESULTS A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95\% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P<0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7\% with remdesivir and 11.9\% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4\% with remdesivir and 15.2\% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6\%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6\%). CONCLUSIONS Our data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

   abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {A new reporter system has been developed for measuring translation coupling efficiency of recoding mechanisms such as frameshifting or readthrough. A recoding test sequence is cloned in between the renilla and firefly luciferase reporter genes and the two luciferase activities are subsequently measured in the same tube. The normalized ratio of the two activities is proportional to the efficiency with which the ribosome 'reads' the recoding signal making the transition from one open reading frame to the next. The internal control from measuring both activities provides a convenient and reliable assay of efficiency. This is the first enzymatic dual reporter assay suitable for in vitro translation. Translation signals can be tested in vivo and in vitro from a single construct, which allows an intimate comparison between the two systems. The assay is applicable for high throughput screening procedures. The dual-luciferase reporter system has been applied to in vivo and in vitro recoding of HIV-1 gag-pol, MMTV gag-pro, MuLV gag-pol, and human antizyme.},

   abstract = {DNA origami has attracted substantial attention since its invention ten years ago, due to the seemingly infinite possibilities that it affords for creating customized nanoscale objects. Although the basic concept of DNA origami is easy to understand, using custom DNA origami in practical applications requires detailed know-how for designing and producing the particles with sufficient quality and for preparing them at appropriate concentrations with the necessary degree of purity in custom environments. Such know-how is not readily available for newcomers to the field, thus slowing down the rate at which new applications outside the field of DNA nanotechnology may emerge. To foster faster progress, we share in this article the experience in making and preparing DNA origami that we have accumulated over recent years. We discuss design solutions for creating advanced structural motifs including corners and various types of hinges that expand the design space for the more rigid multilayer DNA origami and provide guidelines for preventing undesired aggregation and on how to induce specific oligomerization of multiple DNA origami building blocks. In addition, we provide detailed protocols and discuss the expected results for five key methods that allow efficient and damage-free preparation of DNA origami. These methods are agarose-gel purification, filtration through molecular cut-off membranes, PEG precipitation, size-exclusion chromatography, and ultracentrifugation-based sedimentation. The guide for creating advanced design motifs and the detailed protocols with their experimental characterization that we describe here should lower the barrier for researchers to accomplish the full DNA origami production workflow.},

Through programmable self-assembly, strands of DNA are directed to form a custom-shaped bundle of tightly cross-linked double helices, arrayed in parallel to their helical axes. Targeted insertions and deletions of base pairs cause the DNA bundles to develop twist of either handedness or to curve.

We also combined multiple curved elements to build several different types of intricate nanostructures, such as a wireframe beach ball or square-toothed gears.},

Moreover, RNA has a flexible structure and possesses catalytic functions that are similar to proteins. Although RNA nanotechnology resembles DNA nanotechnology in many ways, the base-pairing rules for constructing nanoparticles are different. The large variety of loops and motifs found in RNA allows it to fold into numerous complicated structures, and this diversity provides a platform for identifying viable building blocks for various applications. The thermal stability of RNA also allows the production of multivalent nanostructures with defined stoichiometry. Here we review techniques for constructing RNA nanoparticles from different building blocks, we describe the distinct attributes of RNA inside the body, and discuss potential applications of RNA nanostructures in medicine.

   abstract = {DNA has become one of the most extensively used molecular building blocks for engineering self-assembling materials. DNA origami is a technique that uses hundreds of short DNA oligonucleotides, called staple strands, to fold a long single-stranded DNA, which is called a scaffold strand, into various designer nanoscale architectures. DNA origami has dramatically improved the complexity and scalability of DNA nanostructures. Due to its high degree of customization and spatial addressability, DNA origami provides a versatile platform with which to engineer nanoscale structures and devices that can sense, compute, and actuate. These capabilities open up opportunities for a broad range of applications in chemistry, biology, physics, material science, and computer science that have often required programmed spatial control of molecules and atoms in three-dimensional (3D) space. This review provides a comprehensive survey of recent developments in DNA origami structure, design, assembly, and directed self-assembly, as well as its broad applications.},

Precise control over the 3D solution shape and mechanical flexibility of target designs is important to achieve desired functionality. Because experimental validation of designed nanostructures is time-consuming and cost-intensive, predictive physical models of nanostructure shape and flexibility have the capacity to enhance dramatically the design process. Here, we significantly extend and experimentally validate a computational modeling framework for DNA origami previously presented as CanDo [Castro,C.E., Kilchherr,F., Kim,D.-N., Shiao,E.L., Wauer,T., Wortmann,P., Bathe,M., Dietz,H. (2011) A primer to scaffolded DNA origami. Nat. Meth., 8, 221-229.]. 3D solution shape and flexibility are predicted from basepair connectivity maps now accounting for nicks in the DNA double helix, entropic elasticity of single-stranded DNA, and distant crossovers required to model wireframe structures, in addition to previous modeling (Castro,C.E., et al.) that accounted only for the canonical twist, bend and stretch stiffness of double-helical DNA domains. Systematic experimental validation of nanostructure flexibility mediated by internal crossover density probed using a 32-helix DNA bundle demonstrates for the first time that our model not only predicts the 3D solution shape of complex DNA nanostructures but also their mechanical flexibility. Thus, our model represents an important advance in the quantitative understanding of DNA-based nanostructure shape and flexibility, and we anticipate that this model will increase significantly the number and variety of synthetic nanostructures designed using nucleic acids. © 2011 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {RNA nanostructures can be used as scaffolds to organize, combine, and control molecular functionalities, with great potential for applications in nanomedicine and synthetic biology. The single-stranded RNA origami method allows RNA nanostructures to be folded as they are transcribed by the RNA polymerase. RNA origami structures provide a stable framework that can be decorated with functional RNA elements such as riboswitches, ribozymes, interaction sites, and aptamers for binding small molecules or protein targets. The rich library of RNA structural and functional elements combined with the possibility to attach proteins through aptamer-based binding creates virtually limitless possibilities for constructing advanced RNA-based nanodevices. In this chapter we provide a detailed protocol for the single-stranded RNA origami design method using a simple 2-helix tall structure as an example. The first step involves 3D modeling of a doublecrossover between two RNA double helices, followed by decoration with tertiary motifs. The second step deals with the construction of a 2D blueprint describing the secondary structure and sequence constraints that serves as the input for computer programs. In the third step, computer programs are used to design RNA sequences that are compatible with the structure, and the resulting outputs are evaluated and converted into DNA sequences to order.},

   abstract = {H ere I describe early research on RNA structure and the discovery of the DNA-RNA hybrid helix, a key component of information transfer. More than 50 years ago it was realized that the interaction between DNA and RNA was at the core of molecular biology. The problem was chemical in nature: could two different types of molecules interact and serve in the transmission of biological information? In the 1950s it was widely assumed that "DNA makes RNA, RNA makes protein." This was not based on experimental evidence that DNA and RNA could combine but was more in the nature of an intuitive belief. However, by early 1960 I was finally able to carry out a direct experiment, the first DNA-RNA hybridization. In 1960, messenger RNA was still 1 year in the future, and there was not a great deal of understanding of the major components of information transfer. The DNA double helix proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953 (1) clearly suggested that information was contained in the order of nucleotides, but during the 1950s our understanding of RNA was fragmentary. The origins of the 1960 experiment go back to the mid-1950s. In 1954, while at Caltech, Jim Watson and I had been trying to find out if RNA by itself could form a double helix, but the fiber diffraction studies of RNA gave inconclusive results (2, 3). The fuzzy diffraction patterns all looked alike, but unlike DNA, the RNA base ratios were all different in the samples we examined. It was clear that RNA was more complex than DNA, and its structure was unknown. In their 1953 paper Watson and Crick (1) pointed out that it was probably impossible to form their double helix with ribose due to van der Waals interference of the 2-OH with the structure. Thus, it was likely to be different.},

This complex facilitates nucleo-cytoplasmic export of these mRNAs. The precise secondary structure of the HIV-1 RRE has been controversial, since studies have reported alternative structures comprising either four or five stem-loops. The published structures differ only in regions that lie outside of the primary Rev binding site. Using in-gel SHAPE, we have now determined that the wt NL4-3 RRE exists as a mixture of both structures. To assess functional differences between these RRE 'conformers', we created conformationally locked mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. Using subgenomic reporters, as well as HIV replication assays, we demonstrate that the five stem-loop form of the RRE promotes greater functional Rev/RRE activity compared to the four stem-loop counterpart.},

As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle. Despite this, only a handful of functionally-conserved coronavirus structural RNA elements have been identified to date. Here, we performed RNA structure probing to obtain single-base resolution secondary structure maps of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome both in vitro and in living infected cells. Probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5' UTR and s2m), and reveal new structures. Of these, ∼10.2\% show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of these segments further allowed for the identification of putative druggable pockets. In addition, we identify a set of single-stranded segments in vivo, showing high sequence conservation, suitable for the development of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics.

An analysis to characterize the structure of the RNA genome provided a revised model of the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting element, in particular its attenuator hairpin. By studying an RNA-focused small molecule collection, we identified a drug-like small molecule (C5) that avidly binds to the revised attenuator hairpin structure with a Kd of 11 nM. The compound stabilizes the hairpin's folded state and impairs frameshifting in cells. The ligand was further elaborated into a ribonuclease targeting chimera (RIBOTAC) to recruit a cellular ribonuclease to destroy the viral genome (C5-RIBOTAC) and into a covalent molecule (C5-Chem-CLIP) that validated direct target engagement and demonstrated its specificity for the viral RNA, as compared to highly expressed host mRNAs. The RIBOTAC lead optimization strategy improved the bioactivity of the compound at least 10-fold.

According to the most optimistic projections, it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, so the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virusspecific targets for small molecule-based interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called programmed 21 ribosomal frameshift (21 PRF) to control the relative expression of their proteins. Previous analyses of SARS-CoV have revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot that stimulates high 21 PRF rates and that it also harbors a 21 PRF attenuation element. Altering 21 PRF activity impairs virus replication, suggesting that this activity may be therapeutically targeted. Here, we comparatively analyzed the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV- 2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar 21 PRF rates and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablate 21 PRF activity. We noted that the upstream attenuator hairpin activity is also functionally retained in both viruses, despite differences in the primary sequence in this region. Small-angle X-ray scattering analyses indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit21 PRF was similarly effective against 21 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may be promising lead compounds to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 Kelly et al.},

On six noncoding RNAs with crystallographic models, DMS-guided modeling achieves overall false negative and false discovery rates of 9.5\% and 11.6\%, respectively, comparable to or better than those of SHAPE-guided modeling, and bootstrapping provides straightforward confidence estimates. Integrating DMS-SHAPE data and including 1-cyclohexyl(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT) reactivities provide small additional improvements. These results establish DMS mapping, an already routine technique, as a quantitative tool for unbiased RNA secondary structure modeling. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1. To understand the pathogenicity and antigenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop therapeutic tools, it is essential to profile the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The current map of SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity is based on computational predictions and relies on homology with other coronaviruses. As the protein complement varies among coronaviruses, especially in regard to the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Here, using a suite of ribosome-profiling techniques2–4, we present a high-resolution map of coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which enables us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORFs) and to identify 23 unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs that are likely to have a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; instead, virus translation dominates host translation because of the high levels of viral transcripts. Our work provides a resource that will form the basis of future functional studies.},

Nonetheless, RNA origami as a method for nanofabrication is not yet fully explored and the majority of RNA nanostructures are based on natural pre-folded RNA. Here we describe a biologically inert and uniquely addressable RNA origami scaffold that self-assembles into a nanoribbon by seven staple strands. An algorithm is applied to generate a synthetic De Bruijn scaffold sequence that is characterized by the lack of biologically active sites and repetitions larger than a predetermined design parameter. This RNA scaffold and the complementary staples fold in a physiologically compatible isothermal condition. In order to monitor the folding, we designed a new split Broccoli aptamer system. The aptamer is divided into two nonfunctional sequences each of which is integrated into the 5' or 3' end of two staple strands complementary to the RNA scaffold. Using fluorescence measurements and in-gel imaging, we demonstrate that once RNA origami assembly occurs, the split aptamer sequences are brought into close proximity forming the aptamer and turning on the fluorescence. This light-up 'bio-orthogonal' RNA origami provides a prototype that can have potential for in vivo origami applications.},

Pseudoknots occur relatively rarely in RNA but are highly overrepresented in functionally criticalmotifs in large catalytic RNAs, in riboswitches, and in regulatory elements of viruses. Pseudoknots are usually excluded from RNAstructure prediction algorithms. Whenincluded, these pairings are difficult to model accurately, especially in large RNAs, because allowing this structure dramatically increases the number of possible incorrect folds and because it is difficult to search the fold space for an optimal structure. We have developed a concise secondary structure modeling approach that combines SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) experimental chemical probing information and a simple, but robust, energy model for the entropic cost of single pseudoknot formation. Structures are predicted with iterative refinement, using a dynamic programming algorithm. This melded experimental and thermodynamic energy function predicted the secondary structures and the pseudoknots for a set of 21 challenging RNAs of known structure ranging in size from 34 to 530 nt. On average, 93\% of known base pairs were predicted, and all pseudoknots in wellfolded RNAs were identified.},

To examine this possibility a cDNA fragment containing the F1/F2 overlap region was cloned within a marker gene and placed under the control of the bacteriophage SP6 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Messenger RNA transcribed from this plasmid, when translated in cell-free systems, specified the synthesis of polypeptides whose size was entirely consistent with the products predicted by an efficient ribosomal frame-shifting event within the overlap region. The nature of the products was confirmed by their reactivity with antisera raised against defined portions of the flanking marker gene. This is the first non-retroviral example of ribosomal frame-shifting in higher eukaryotes.},

We synthesized a panel of contiguous cDNAs that spanned the entire genome. Following contig assembly into genome-length cDNA, transfected full-length transcripts recovered several recombinant viruses (rMERS-CoV) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones. Because the wild-type MERS-CoV contains a tissue culture-adapted T1015N mutation in the S glycoprotein, rMERS-CoV replicated ∼0.5 log less efficiently than wild-type virus. In addition, we ablated expression of the accessory protein ORF5 (rMERS·ORF5) and replaced it with tomato red fluorescent protein (rMERS-RFP) or deleted the entire ORF3, 4, and 5 accessory cluster (rMERS-ΔORF3-5). Recombinant rMERSCoV, rMERS-CoV·ORF5, and MERS-CoV-RFP replicated to high titers, whereas MERS-ΔORF3-5 showed 1-1.5 logs reduced titer compared with rMERS-CoV. Northern blot analyses confirmed the associated molecular changes in the recombinant viruses, and sequence analysis demonstrated that RFP was expressed from the appropriate consensus sequence AACGAA. We further show dipeptidyl peptidase 4 expression, MERS-CoV replication, and RNA and protein synthesis in human airway epithelial cell cultures, primary lung fibroblasts, primary lung microvascular endothelial cells, and primary alveolar type II pneumocytes, demonstrating a much broader tissue tropism than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

According to our analysis, the index-PCR for sample preparation has no effect on the observed error rate, even though PCR is traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced error rates in NGS. In addition, we observed very persistent pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The average error rate determined was 0.24 ± 0.06\% per base and the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 ± 1.24\%. Constant regions at the 5'- and 3'-end, e.g., primer binding sites used in in vitro selection procedures seem to have no effect on mutation rates and re-sequencing of samples obtains very reproducible results.

   abstract = {RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Structural signatures at translational start sites and ribosome pause sites are conserved from in vitro conditions, suggesting that these RNA elements are programmed by sequence. In contrast, focal structural rearrangements in vivo reveal precise interfaces of RNA with RNA-binding proteins or RNA-modification sites that are consistent with atomic-resolution structural data. Such dynamic structural footprints enable accurate prediction of RNA-protein interactions and N 6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification genome wide.

We present a protocol for genome-wide, quantitative analysis of in vivo translation by deep sequencing. This ribosome profiling approach maps the exact positions of ribosomes on transcripts by nuclease footprinting. The nuclease-protected mRNA fragments are converted into a DNA library suitable for deep sequencing using a strategy that minimizes bias. The abundance of different footprint fragments in deep sequencing data reports on the amount of translation of a gene. In addition, footprints reveal the exact regions of the transcriptome that are translated. To better define translated reading frames, we describe an adaptation that reveals the sites of translation initiation by pretreating cells with harringtonine to immobilize initiating ribosomes. The protocol we describe requires 5-7 days to generate a completed ribosome profiling sequencing library. Sequencing and data analysis require a further 4-5 days. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

   abstract = {In addition to encoding RNA primary structures, genomes also encode RNA secondary and tertiary structures that play roles in gene regulation and, in the case of RNA viruses, genome replication. Methods for the identification of functional RNA structures in genomes typically rely on scanning analysis windows, where multiple partially-overlapping windows are used to predict RNA structures and folding metrics to deduce regions likely to form functional structure. Separate structural models are produced for each window, where the step size can greatly affect the returned model. This makes deducing unique local structures challenging, as the same nucleotides in each window can be alternatively base paired. We are presenting here a new approach where all base pairs from analysis windows are considered and weighted by favorable folding. This results in unique base pairing throughout the genome and the generation of local regions/structures that can be ranked by their propensity to form unusually thermodynamically stable folds. We applied this approach to the Zika virus (ZIKV) and HIV-1 genomes. ZIKV is linked to a variety of neurological ailments including microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome and its (+)-sense RNA genome encodes two, previously described, functionally essential structured RNA regions. HIV, the cause of AIDS, contains multiple functional RNA motifs in its genome, which have been extensively studied. Our approach is able to successfully identify and model the structures of known functional motifs in both viruses, while also finding additional regions likely to form functional structures. All data have been archived at the RNAStructuromeDB (www.structurome.bb.iastate.edu), a repository of RNA folding data for humans and their pathogens.},

Many of these RNA structures are assembled from a collection of RNA structural motifs. These basic building blocks are used repeatedly, and in various combinations, to form different RNA types and define their unique structural and functional properties. Identification of recurring RNA structural motifs will therefore enhance our understanding of RNA structure and help associate elements of RNA structure with functional and regulatory elements. Our goal was to develop a computer program that can describe an RNA structural element of any complexity and then search any nucleotide sequence database, including the complete prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, for these structural elements. Here we describe in detail a new computational motif search algorithm, RNAMotif, and demonstrate its utility with some motif search examples. RNAMotif differs from other motif search tools in two important aspects: first, the structure definition language is more flexible and can specify any type of base-base interaction; second, RNAMotif provides a user controlled scoring section that can be used to add capabilities that patterns alone cannot provide.},

   abstract = {In retroviruses and the double-stranded RNA totiviruses, the efficiency of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is critical for ensuring the proper ratios of upstream-encoded capsid proteins to downstream-encoded replicase enzymes. The genomic organizations of many other frameshifting viruses, including the coronaviruses, are very different, in that their upstream open reading frames encode nonstructural proteins, the frameshift-dependent downstream open reading frames encode enzymes involved in transcription and replication, and their structural proteins are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs. The biological significance of frameshifting efficiency and how the relative ratios of proteins encoded by the upstream and downstream open reading frames affect virus propagation has not been explored before. Here, three different strategies were employed to test the hypothesis that the -1 PRF signals of coronaviruses have evolved to produce the correct ratios of upstream- to downstream-encoded proteins. Specifically, infectious clones of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus harboring mutations that lower frameshift efficiency decreased infectivity by >4 orders of magnitude. Second, a series of frameshift-promoting mRNA pseudoknot mutants was employed to demonstrate that the frameshift signals of the SARS-associated coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus have evolved to promote optimal frameshift efficiencies. Finally, we show that a previously described frameshift attenuator element does not actually affect frameshifting per se but rather serves to limit the fraction of ribosomes available for frameshifting. The findings of these analyses all support a “golden mean” model in which viruses use both programmed ribosomal frameshifting and translational attenuation to control the relative ratios of their encoded proteins.},

   abstract = {The -1 ribosomal frameshifting requires the existence of an in cis RNA slippery sequence and is promoted by a downstream stimulator RNA. An atypical RNA pseudoknot with an extra stem formed by complementary sequences within loop 2 of an H-type pseudoknot is characterized in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) genome. This pseudoknot can serve as an efficient stimulator for -1 frameshifting in vitro. Mutational analysis of the extra stem suggests frameshift efficiency can be modulated via manipulation of the secondary structure within the loop 2 of an infectious bronchitis virus-type pseudoknot. More importantly, an upstream RNA sequence separated by a linker 5' to the slippery site is also identified to be capable of modulating the -1 frameshift efficiency. RNA sequence containing this attenuation element can downregulate -1 frameshifting promoted by an atypical pseudoknot of SARS CoV and two other pseudoknot stimulators. Furthermore, frameshift efficiency can be reduced to half in the presence of the attenuation signal in vivo. Therefore, this in cis RNA attenuator represents a novel negative determinant of general importance for the regulation of -1 frameshift efficiency, and is thus a potential antiviral target. © The Author 2005.

   abstract = {RNA structures are unwound for decoding. In the process, they can pause the elongating ribosome for regulation. An example is the stimulation of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting, leading to 3' direction slippage of the reading-frame during elongation, by specific pseudoknot stimulators downstream of the frameshifting site. By investigating a recently identified regulatory element upstream of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) -1 frameshifting site, it is shown that a minimal functional element with hairpin forming potential is sufficient to down-regulate-1 frameshifting activity. Mutagenesis to disrupt or restore base pairs in the potential hairpin stem reveals that base-pair formation is required for-1 frameshifting attenuation in vitro and in 293T cells. The attenuation efficiency of a hairpin is determined by its stability and proximity to the frameshifting site; however, it is insensitive to E site sequence variation. Additionally, using a dual luciferase assay, it can be shown that a hairpin stimulated +1 frameshifting when placed upstream of a +1 shifty site in yeast. The investigations indicate that the hairpin is indeed a cis-acting programmed reading-frame switch modulator. This result provides insight into mechanisms governing-1 frameshifting stimulation and attenuation. Since the upstream hairpin is unwound (by a marching ribosome) before the downstream stimulator, this study's findings suggest a new mode of translational regulation that is mediated by the reformed stem of a ribosomal unwound RNA hairpin during elongation. © 2013 Cho et al.},

   abstract = {A wide range of RNA viruses use programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting for the production of viral fusion proteins. Inspection of the overlap regions between ORF1a and ORF1b of the SARS-CoV genome revealed that, similar to all coronaviruses, a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift could be used by the virus to produce a fusion protein. Computational analyses of the frameshift signal predicted the presence of an mRNA pseudoknot containing three double-stranded RNA stem structures rather than two. Phylogenetic analyses showed the conservation of potential three-stemmed pseudoknots in the frameshift signals of all other coronaviruses in the GenBank database. Though the presence of the three-stemmed structure is supported by nuclease mapping and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance studies, our findings suggest that interactions between the stem structures may result in local distortions in the A-form RNA. These distortions are particularly evident in the vicinity of predicted A-bulges in stems 2 and 3. In vitro and in vivo frameshifting assays showed that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal is functionally similar to other viral frameshift signals: it promotes efficient frameshifting in all of the standard assay systems, and it is sensitive to a drug and a genetic mutation that are known to affect frameshifting efficiency of a yeast virus. Mutagenesis studies reveal that both the specific sequences and structures of stems 2 and 3 are important for efficient frameshifting. We have identified a new RNA structural motif that is capable of promoting efficient programmed ribosomal frameshifting. The high degree of conservation of three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot structures among the coronaviruses suggests that this presents a novel target for antiviral therapeutics. © 2005 Plant et al.},

The global structure was identified by a cleavage experiment under native conditions using a short complementary oligonucleotide and RNase H. Structural analyses indicate a three-domain structure of αY69 consisting of two stem-loop elements connected by a seven-nucleotide single-stranded hinge region. Kinetic data suggest that the formation of base pairs between a CGC triplet of αY69 and its target RNA is essential for fast annealing. The complementary sequence stretch of the target folds into a high-energy secondary structure. The relationship between modifications in structural elements of αY69 and the annealing kinetics suggested that rate-limiting steps of the annealing involve a single site of αY69 and do not involve its 5' or 3'-end. Further, the data indicate that both initial base-specific interactions and duplex formation are dependent on the CGC triplet of the central region of αY69.

We present a probability profile approach for the prediction of these regions based on a statistical algorithm for sampling RNA secondary structures. For the prediction of phylogenetically-determined single-stranded regions in secondary structures of representative RNA sequences, the probability profile offers substantial improvement over the minimum free energy structure. In designing antisense oligonucleotides, a practical problem is how to select a secondary structure for the target mRNA from the optimal structure(s) and many suboptimal structures with similar free energies. By summarizing the information from a statistical sample of probable secondary structures in a single plot, the probability profile not only presents a solution to this dilemma, but also reveals 'well-determined' single-stranded regions through the assignment of probabilities as measures of confidence in predictions. In antisense application to the rabbit β-globin mRNA, a significant correlation between hybridization potential predicted by the probability profile and the degree of inhibition of in vitro translation suggests that the probability profile approach is valuable for the identification of effective antisense target sites. Coupling computational design with DNA-RNA array technique provides a rational, efficient framework for antisense oligonucleotide screening. This framework has the potential for high-throughput applications to functional genomics and drug target validation.},

These processes all involve RNA-protein interactions between the N protein and viral RNAs. To better understand the RNA-binding properties of this multifunctional protein, the N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a chimeric protein fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Biochemical analyses of RNA-binding properties were performed on full-length and partial N protein segments to define the RNA-binding domain. The full-length N protein and the GST-N protein fusion product had similar binding activities with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 14 nM when the MHV 5'-leader sequence was used as ligand. The smallest N protein fragment which retained RNA-binding activity was a 55 aa segment containing residues 177-231 which bound viral RNA with a K(d) of 32 nM. A consensus viral sequence recognized by the N protein was inferred from these studies; AAUCYAAAC was identified to be the potential minimum ligand for the N protein. Although the core UCYAA sequence is often tandemly repeated in viral genomes, ligands containing one or more repeats of UCYAA showed no difference in binding to the N protein. Together these data demonstrate a high-affinity, specific interaction between the N protein and a conserved RNA sequence present at the 5'-ends of MHV mRNA.},

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported recently, its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events. In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif, AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the modification and the 3' tail. Functional investigation of the unknown transcripts and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome reveal a complex array of canonical and non-canonical viral transcripts with RNA modifications.},

   abstract = {Live virus vaccines provide significant protection against many detrimental human and animal diseases, but reversion to virulence by mutation and recombination has reduced appeal. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as a model, we engineered a different transcription regulatory circuit and isolated recombinant viruses. The transcription network allowed for efficient expression of the viral transcripts and proteins, and the recombinant viruses replicated to WT levels. Recombinant genomes were then constructed that contained mixtures of the WT and mutant regulatory circuits, reflecting recombinant viruses that might occur in nature. Although viable viruses could readily be isolated from WT and recombinant genomes containing homogeneous transcription circuits, chimeras that contained mixed regulatory networks were invariantly lethal, because viable chimeric viruses were not isolated. Mechanistically, mixed regulatory circuits promoted inefficient subgenomic transcription from inappropriate start sites, resulting in truncated ORFs and effectively minimize viral structural protein expression. Engineering regulatory transcription circuits of intercommunicating alleles successfully introduces genetic traps into a viral genome that are lethal in RNA recombinant progeny viruses. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {The 5' 140 nucleotides of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) are predicted to contain three secondary structures, stem-loop 1 (SL1), SL2, and SL4. SL1 and SL2 are required for subgenomic RNA synthesis. The current study focuses on SL4, which contains two base-paired regions, SL4a and SL4b. A series of reverse genetic experiments show that SL4a is not required to be base paired. Neither the structure, the sequence, nor the putative 8-amino-acid open reading frame (ORF) in SL4b is required for viral replication. Viruses containing separate deletions of SL4a and SL4b are viable. However, deletion of SL4 is lethal, and genomes carrying this deletion are defective in directing subgenomic RNA synthesis. Deletion of (131)ACA(133) just 3' to SL4 has a profound impact on viral replication. Viruses carrying the (131)ACA(133) deletion were heterogeneous in plaque size. We isolated three viruses with second-site mutations in the 5'UTR which compensated for decreased plaque sizes, delayed growth kinetics, and lower titers associated with the (131)ACA(133) deletion. The second-site mutations are predicted to change either the spacing between SL1 and SL2 or that between SL2 and SL4 or to destabilize the proximal portion of SL4a in our model. A mutant constructed by replacing SL4 with a shorter sequence-unrelated stem-loop was viable. These results suggest that the proposed SL4 in the MHV 5'UTR functions in part as a spacer element that orients SL1, SL2, and the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS), and this spacer function may play an important role in directing subgenomic RNA synthesis.},

As experimental data on mRNA structure are scarce, accurate structure prediction is required to characterize RNA regulatory mechanisms. Although various structure prediction approaches are available, it is often unclear which to choose and how to set their parameters. Furthermore, no standard measure to compare predictions of local structure exists. We assessed the performance of different methods using two types of data: transcriptome-wide enzymatic probing information and a large, curated set of cis-regulatory elements. To compare the approaches, we introduced structure accuracy, a measure that is applicable to both global and local methods. Our results showed that local folding was more accurate than the classic global approach. We investigated how the locality parameters, maximum base pair span and window size, influenced the prediction performance. A span of 150 provided a reasonable balance between maximizing the number of accurately predicted base pairs, while minimizing effects of incorrect long-range predictions. We characterized the error at artificial sequence ends, which we reduced by setting the window size sufficiently greater than the maximum span. Our method, Local Fold, diminished all border effects and produced the most robust performance. © The Author(s) 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.},

   abstract = {Previously, a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genomic sequence necessary for defective interfering (DI) RNA packaging into MHV particles (packaging signal) was mapped to within a region of 1,480 nucleotides in the MHV polymerase gene by comparison of two DI RNAs. One of these, DIssF, is 3.6 kb in size and exhibits efficient packaging, whereas the other, DIssE, which is 2.3 kb, does not. For more precise mapping, a series of mutant DIssF RNAs with deletions within this 1,480-nucleotide region were constructed. After transfection of in vitro-synthesized mutant DI RNA in MHV-infected cells, the virus product was passaged several times. The efficiency of DI RNA packaging into MHV virions was then estimated by viral homologous interference activity and by analysis of intracellular virus-specific RNAs and virion RNA. The results indicated that an area of 190 nucleotides was necessary for packaging. A computer-generated secondary structural analysis of the A59 and JHM strains of MHV demonstrated that within this 190-nucleotide region a stable stem-loop of 69 nucleotides was common between the two viruses. A DIssE-derived DI DNA which had these 69 nucleotides inserted into the DIssE sequence demonstrated efficient DI RNA packaging. Site-directed mutagenic analysis showed that of these 69 nucleotides, the minimum sequence of the packaging signal was 61 nucleotides and that destruction of the secondary structure abolished packaging ability. These studies demonstrated that an MHV packaging signal was present within the 61 nucleotides, which are located on MHV genomic RNA 1,381 to 1,441 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end of gene 1.},

A consensus secondary structural model of the 5' 140 nucleotides of the 5' UTRs of nine coronaviruses (CoVs) derived from all three major CoV groups is presented and characterized by three major stem-loops, SL1, SL2, and SL4. NMR spectroscopy provides structural support for SL1 and SL2 in three group 2 CoVs, including MHV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43. SL2 is conserved in all CoVs, typically containing a pentaloop (C47-U48-U49-G50-U51 in MHV) stacked on a 5 base-pair stem, with some sequences containing an additional U 3' to U51; SL2 therefore possesses sequence features consistent with a U-turn-like conformation. The imino protons of U48 in the wild-type RNA, and G48 in the U48G SL2 mutant RNA, are significantly protected from exchange with solvent, consistent with a hydrogen bonding interaction critical to the hairpin loop architecture. SL2 is required for MHV replication; MHV genomes containing point substitutions predicted to perturb the SL2 structure (U48C, U48A) were not viable, while those that maintain the structure (U48G and U49A) were viable. The U48C MHV mutant supports both positive- and negative-sense genome-sized RNA synthesis, but fails to direct the synthesis of positive- or negative-sense subgenomic RNAs. These data support the existence of the SL2 in our models, and further suggest a critical role in coronavirus replication. Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

Viral replication is regulated at many levels, including the use of conserved genomic RNA structures. Most potential regulatory elements in viral RNA genomes are uncharacterized. Here we report the structure of an entire HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution using SHAPE, a high-throughput RNA analysis technology. The genome encodes protein structure at two levels. In addition to the correspondence between RNA and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of RNA structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in HIV proteins. This correlation suggests that RNA structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding. Some simple genome elements previously shown to be important, including the ribosomal gag-pol frameshift stem-loop, are components of larger RNA motifs. We also identify organizational principles for unstructured RNA regions, including splice site acceptors and hypervariable regions. These results emphasize that the HIV-1 genome and, potentially, many coding RNAs are punctuated by previously unrecognized regulatory motifs and that extensive RNA structure constitutes an important component of the genetic code. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Solution nuclear magnetic resonance experiments are consistent with a 5'-uYNMG(U)a or uCUYG(U)a tetraloop conformation characterized by an anti -C47- syn -G50 base-pairing interaction, with U51 flipped out into solution and G50 stacked on A52. Previous studies showed that U48C and U48A substitutions in MHV SL2 were lethal, while a U48G substitution was viable. Here, we characterize viruses harboring all remaining single-nucleotide substitutions in the pentaloop of MHV SL2 and also investigate the degree to which the sequence context of key pentaloop point mutations influences the MHV replication phenotype. U49 or U51 substitution mutants all are viable; C47 substitution mutants also are viable but produce slightly smaller plaques than wild-type virus. In contrast, G50A and G50C viruses are severely crippled and form much smaller plaques. Virus could not be recovered from G50U-containing mutants; rather, only true wild-type revertants or a virus, G50U/C47A, containing a second site mutation were recovered. These functional data suggest that the Watson-Crick edges of C47 and G50 (or A47 and U50 in the G50U/C47A mutant) are in close enough proximity to a hydrogen bond with U51 flipped out of the hairpin. Remarkably, increasing the helical stem stability rescues the previously lethal mutants U48C and G50U. These studies suggest that SL2 functions as an important, but rather plastic, structural element in stimulating subgenomic RNA synthesis in coronaviruses. },

Most human coronaviruses commonly cause relatively mild respiratory illnesses; however two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can cause severe illness and death. Investigations over the past 35 years have illuminated many aspects of coronavirus replication. The focus of this review is the functional analysis of conserved RNA secondary structures in the 5' and 3' of the betacoronavirus genomes. The 5' 350 nucleotides folds into a set of RNA secondary structures which are well conserved, and reverse genetic studies indicate that these structures play an important role in the discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic RNAs in the betacoronaviruses. These cis-acting elements extend 3' of the 5'UTR into ORF1a. The 3'UTR is similarly conserved and contains all of the cis-acting sequences necessary for viral replication. Two competing conformations near the 5' end of the 3'UTR have been shown to make up a potential molecular switch. There is some evidence that an association between the 3' and 5'UTRs is necessary for subgenomic RNA synthesis, but the basis for this association is not yet clear. A number of host RNA proteins have been shown to bind to the 5' and 3' cis-acting regions, but the significance of these in viral replication is not clear. Two viral proteins have been identified as binding to the 5' cis-acting region, nsp1 and N protein. A genetic interaction between nsp8 and nsp9 and the region of the 3'UTR that contains the putative molecular switch suggests that these two proteins bind to this region.},

Here we present a first look at RNA sequence conservation and structural propensities in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Using sequence alignments spanning a range of betacoronaviruses, we rank genomic regions by RNA sequence conservation, identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nt as exactly conserved over SARS-related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences subsequently reported from the COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30 “SARS-related-conserved” regions. We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome. We provide 106 “SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured” regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA. We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the extended 5′ UTR, frameshifting stimulation element, and 3′ UTR. Lastly, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome that have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains. These 59 “SARS-CoV-2-conserved-unstructured” genomic regions may be most easily accessible by hybridization in primer-based diagnostic strategies.},

For example, the average positive predictive value, 65.8\%, is increased to 91.0\% when only base pairs with probability of 0.99 or above are considered. The quality of base pair predictions can also be increased by the addition of experimentally determined constraints, including enzymatic cleavage, flavin mononucleotide cleavage, and chemical modification.

Despite the critical role of alternative splicing, the mechanisms that drive the choice of splice site are poorly understood. Synonymous RNA mutations that lead to severe defects in splicing and viral replication indicate the presence of unknown cis-regulatory elements3. Here we use dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) to investigate the structure of HIV-1 RNA in cells, and develop an algorithm that we name ‘detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation–maximization’ (DREEM), which reveals the alternative conformations that are assumed by the same RNA sequence. Contrary to previous models that have analysed population averages4, our results reveal heterogeneous regions of RNA structure across the entire HIV-1 genome. In addition to confirming that in vitro characterized5 alternative structures for the HIV-1 Rev responsive element also exist in cells, we discover alternative conformations at critical splice sites that influence the ratio of transcript isoforms. Our simultaneous measurement of splicing and intracellular RNA structure provides evidence for the long-standing hypothesis6–8 that heterogeneity in RNA conformation regulates splice-site use and viral gene expression.},

   abstract = {RNAz is a widely used software package for de novo detection of structured noncoding RNAs in comparative genomics data. Four years of experience have not only demonstrated the applicability of the approach, but also helped us to identify limitations of the current implementation. RNAz 2.0 provides significant improvements in two respects: (1) The accuracy is increased by the systematic use of dinucleotide models. (2) Technical limitations of the previous version, such as the inability to handle alignments with more than six sequences, are overcome by increased training data and the usage of an entropy measure to represent sequence similarities. RNAz 2.0 shows a significantly lower false discovery rate on a dinucleotide background model than the previous version. Separate models for structural alignments provide an additional way to increase the predictive power.

   abstract = {Almost all RNAs can fold to form extensive base-paired secondary structures. Many of these structures then modulate numerous fundamental elements of gene expression. Deducing these structure-function relationships requires that it be possible to predict RNA secondary structures accurately. However, RNA secondary structure prediction for large RNAs, such that a single predicted structure for a single sequence reliably represents the correct structure, has remained an unsolved problem. Here, we demonstrate that quantitative, nucleotide-resolution information from a SHAPE experiment can be interpreted as a pseudo-free energy change term and used to determine RNA secondary structure with high accuracy. Free energy minimization, by using SHAPE pseudo-free energies, in conjunction with nearest neighbor parameters, predicts the secondary structure of deproteinized Escherichia coli 16S rRNA (>1,300 nt) and a set of smaller RNAs (75-155 nt) with accuracies of up to 96-100\%, which are comparable to the best accuracies achievable by comparative sequence analysis. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {Motivation: For several decades, free energy minimization methods have been the dominant strategy for single sequence RNA secondary structure prediction. More recently, stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) have emerged as an alternative probabilistic methodology for modeling RNA structure. Unlike physics-based methods, which rely on thousands of experimentally-measured thermodynamic parameters, SCFGs use fully-automated statistical learning algorithms to derive model parameters. Despite this advantage, however, probabilistic methods have not replaced free energy minimization methods as the tool of choice for secondary structure prediction, as the accuracies of the best current SCFGs have yet to match those of the best physics-based models. Results: In this paper, we present CONTRAfold, a novel secondary structure prediction method based on conditional log-linear models (CLLMs), a flexible class of probabilistic models which generalize upon SCFGs by using discriminative training and feature-rich scoring. In a series of cross-validation experiments, we show that grammar-based secondary structure prediction methods formulated as CLLMs consistently outperform their SCFG analogs. Furthermore, CONTRAfold, a CLLM incorporating most of the features found in typical thermodynamic models, achieves the highest single sequence prediction accuracies to date, outperforming currently available probabilistic and physics-based techniques. Our result thus closes the gap between probabilistic and thermodynamic models, demonstrating that statistical learning procedures provide an effective alternative to empirical measurement of thermodynamic parameters for RNA secondary structure prediction. © 2006 Oxford University Press.},

However, approaches to transfer the spatial information of DNA constructions to metal nanostructures remain a challenge. We report a DNA-assisted lithography (DALI) method that combines the structural versatility of DNA origami with conventional lithography techniques to create discrete, well-defined, and entirely metallic nanostructures with designed plasmonic properties. DALI is a parallel, high-throughput fabrication method compatible with transparent substrates, thus providing an additional advantage for optical measurements, and yields structures with a feature size of ~10 nm. We demonstrate its feasibility by producing metal nanostructures with a chiral plasmonic response and bowtie-shaped nanoantennas for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. We envisage that DALI can be generalized to large substrates, which would subsequently enable scale-up production of diverse metallic nanostructures with tailored plasmonic features.},

It is now evident that rationally designed programmable RNA nanostructures offer unique advantages in addressing contemporary therapeutic challenges such as distinguishing target cell types and ameliorating disease. However, to maximize the therapeutic benefit of these nanostructures, it is essential to understand the immunostimulatory aptitude of such tools and identify potential complications. This paper presents a set of 16 nanoparticle platforms that are highly configurable. These novel nucleic acid based polygonal platforms are programmed for controllable self-assembly from RNA and/or DNA strands via canonical Watson–Crick interactions. It is demonstrated that the immunostimulatory properties of these particular designs can be tuned to elicit the desired immune response or lack thereof. To advance the current understanding of the nanoparticle properties that contribute to the observed immunomodulatory activity and establish corresponding designing principles, quantitative structure–activity relationship modeling is conducted. The results demonstrate that molecular weight, together with melting temperature and half-life, strongly predicts the observed immunomodulatory activity. This framework provides the fundamental guidelines necessary for the development of a new library of nanoparticles with predictable immunomodulatory activity.},

Although there has been much agreement that a small fraction of these genomes has important biological functions, there has been much debate as to whether the rest contributes to development and/or homeostasis. Much of the speculation has centered on the genomic regions that are transcribed into RNA at some low level. Unfortunately these RNAs have been arbitrarily assigned various names, such as "intergenic RNA," "long non-coding RNAs" etc., which have led to some confusion in the field. Many researchers believe that these transcripts represent a vast, unchartered world of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), simply because they exist. However, there are reasons to question this Panglossian view because it ignores our current understanding of how evolution shapes eukaryotic genomes and how the gene expression machinery works in eukaryotic cells. Although there are undoubtedly many more functional ncRNAs yet to be discovered and characterized, it is also likely that many of these transcripts are simply junk. Here, we discuss how to determine whether any given ncRNA has a function. Importantly, we advocate that in the absence of any such data, the appropriate null hypothesis is that the RNA in question is junk.},

Employing unconstrained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations we are able to reproduce the qualitatively different twist-stretch coupling for dsDNA and dsRNA in semi-quantitative agreement with experiment. Similar results are also found in simulations that include an external torque to induce over- or unwinding of DNA and RNA. Detailed analysis of the helical deformations coupled to twist indicate that the interplay of helical rise, base pair inclination and displacement from the helix axis upon twist changes are responsible for the different twist-stretch correlations. Overwinding of RNA results in more compact conformations with a narrower major groove and consequently reduced helical extension. Overwinding of DNA decreases the size of the minor groove and the resulting positive base pair inclination leads to a slender and more extended helical structure.},

However, the importance of nucleation in the kinetics of DNA-origami self-assembly, which involves both the binding of staple strands and the folding of the scaffold strand, is unclear. Here, using Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice model of DNA origami, we find that some, but not all, designs can have a nucleation barrier and that this barrier disappears at lower temperatures, rationalizing the success of isothermal assembly. We show that the height of the nucleation barrier depends primarily on the coaxial stacking of staples that are adjacent on the same helix, a parameter that can be modified with staple design. Creating a nucleation barrier to DNA-origami assembly could be useful in optimizing assembly times and yields, while eliminating the barrier may allow for fast molecular sensors that can assemble/disassemble without hysteresis in response to changes in the environment.},

Examination of PTM profiles of individual viral genomes isolated by affinity capture revealed a plethora of PTMs on viral RNAs, which far exceeds the handful of well-characterized modifications. Direct comparison of viral epitranscriptomes identified common and virus-specific PTMs. In particular, specific dimethylcytosine modifications were only present in total RNA from virus-infected cells, and in intracellular HCV RNA, and viral RNA from Zika and HCV virions. Moreover, dimethylcytosine abundance during viral infection was modulated by the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6.

   abstract = {R NAs fold into complex structures that are crucial for their functions and regulations including transcription, processing , localization, translation and decay 1-6. Over the past few decades RNA structure has been studied extensively in vitro and in silico, and crystallography and cryo-EM structures of molecular machines such as the spliceosome and ribosome, containing RNAs at their core, have become available 7,8. In recent years technologies have been developed to map RNA secondary structures for the whole transcriptome, that is, RNA structuromes, by combining biochemical probing with deep sequencing 9-16. These systems biology studies have revealed many novel insights on the RNA structure basis of gene regulation 17-20. However, so far, existing genome-wide structure probing studies have focused on whole-cell data, which only represent an ensemble average of RNA molecules in different subcellular compartments. In fact, RNA undergoes a complex life cycle in eukaryotic cells, mirrored by its movement into distinct cytotopic locales 4,21. RNA structure is thought to form co-transcriptionally on the chromatin template, undergo conformational changes resulting from RNA chemical modification and processing in the nucleus, and experience further changes in the cytoplasm during translation and RNA decay. Averaging the RNA structure signal in the entire cell may obscure these critical features. More importantly, detailed mapping of RNA structures in vivo will help to elucidate how they are regulated , which is essential to understanding the RNA structure basis for the regulation of gene expression. An important driving force that regulates the landscape of RNA structural changes in post-transcription regulation are the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). A study in Arabidopsis revealed that RNA secondary structure is anti-correlated with protein-binding density 22. We recently used icSHAPE to probe RNA structuromes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and examined the in vivo and in vitro structure profiles of RBFOX2, a splicing factor of the feminizing locus on X (Fox) family proteins; and HuR, an RBP that regulates transcript stability 12. We implemented a machine-learning algorithm and found that using structure signals significantly improved the prediction of RNA-binding sites of both RBPs, suggesting that RNA structure signature analysis is a powerful tool to investigate RNA-RBP interactions. However, in spite of these recent advances in our understanding of the association between RNA structure and RBP binding, a compendium of the RNA structural basis of RBP binding is not available. In addition to RBP binding, the modification and editing of RNAs are also an important mechanism for the regulation of RNA structure. RNA modification can regulate almost all RNA processes including RNA maturation, nuclear retention and exportation, translation, decay, and cell differentiation and reprogramming as well 23,24. As one of the most abundant and important types of messenger RNA modification, N 6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) has been shown to favor the unwinding of duplex RNAs by conformational switching 12,25,26. The impact of the structure-destabilizing effect of m 6 A is exemplified by a study that investigated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), a splicing factor that preferentially binds to single-stranded polyU tracts 27. Biochemical studies showed that m 6 A modification can disrupt the local RNA structures and promote HNRNPC binding in nearby regions 28. The study defined these m 6 A sites as 'm 6 A-switches' , and identified the enrichment of tens of thousands of m 6 A-switches in the vicinity of HNRNPC-binding sites, thereby altering HNRNPC binding and splicing of the target mRNAs. However, whether RNA structural RNA structure maps across mammalian cellular compartments RNA structure is intimately connected to each step of gene expression. Recent advances have enabled transcriptome-wide maps of RNA secondary structure, called 'RNA structuromes'. However, previous whole-cell analyses lacked the resolution to unravel the landscape and also the regulatory mechanisms of RNA structural changes across subcellular compartments. Here we reveal the RNA structuromes in three compartments, chromatin, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, in human and mouse cells. The cytotopic structuromes substantially expand RNA structural information and enable detailed investigation of the central role of RNA structure in linking transcription, translation and RNA decay. We develop a resource with which to visualize the interplay of RNA-protein interactions, RNA modifications and RNA structure and predict both direct and indirect reader proteins of RNA modifications. We also validate a novel role for the RNA-binding protein LIN28A as an N 6-methyladenosine modification 'anti-reader'. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of RNA structures and its functional importance in gene regulation.},

   abstract = {We describe the RNA folding problem and contrast it with the much more difficult protein folding problem. RNA has four similar monomer units, whereas proteins have 20 very different residues. The folding of RNA is hierarchical in that secondary structure is much more stable than tertiary folding. In RNA the two levels of folding (secondary and tertiary) can be experimentally separated by the presence or absence of Mg2+. Secondary structure can be predicted successfully from experimental thermodynamic data on secondary structure elements: helices, loops, and bulges. Tertiary interactions can then be added without much distortion of the secondary structure. These observations suggest a folding algorithm to predict the structure of an RNA from its sequence. However, to solve the RNA folding problem one needs thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interactions, and identification and characterization of metal-ion binding sites.

   abstract = {The principles of mRNA decoding are conserved among all extant life forms. We present an integrative view of all the interaction networks between mRNA, tRNA and rRNA: the intrinsic stability of codon-anticodon duplex, the conformation of the anticodon hairpin, the presence of modified nucleotides, the occurrence of non-Watson-Crick pairs in the codon-anticodon helix and the interactions with bases of rRNA at the A-site decoding site. We derive a more information-rich, alternative representation of the genetic code, that is circular with an unsymmetrical distribution of codons leading to a clear segregation between GC-rich 4-codon boxes and AU-rich 2:2-codon and 3:1-codon boxes. All tRNA sequence variations can be visualized, within an internal structural and energy framework, for each organism, and each anticodon of the sense codons. The multiplicity and complexity of nucleotide modifications at positions 34 and 37 of the anticodon loop segregate meaningfully, and correlate well with the necessity to stabilize AU-rich codon-anticodon pairs and to avoid miscoding in split codon boxes. The evolution and expansion of the genetic code is viewed as being originally based on GC content with progressive introduction of A/U together with tRNA modifications. The representation we present should help the engineering of the genetic code to include non-natural amino acids.},

   abstract = {Removal of the 5'-leader region is an essential step in the maturation of tRNA molecules in all domains of life. This reaction is catalyzed by various RNase P activities, ranging from ribonucleoproteins with ribozyme activity to protein-only forms. In Escherichia coli, the efficiency of RNase P-mediated cleavage can be controlled by computationally designed riboswitch elements in a ligand-dependent way, where the 5′′-leader sequence of a tRNA precursor is either sequestered in a hairpin structure or presented as a single-stranded region accessible for maturation. In the presented work, the regulatory potential of such artificial constructs is tested on different forms of eukaryotic RNase P enzymes—two protein-only RNase P enzymes (PRORP1 and PRORP2) from Arabidopsis thaliana and the ribonucleoprotein of Homo sapiens. The PRORP enzymes were analyzed in vitro as well as in vivo in a bacterial RNase P complementation system. We also tested in HEK293T cells whether the riboswitches remain functional with human nuclear RNase P. While the regulatory principle of the synthetic riboswitches applies for all tested RNase P enzymes, the results also show differences in the substrate requirements of the individual enzyme versions. Hence, such designed RNase P riboswitches represent a novel tool to investigate the impact of the structural composition of the 5′′-leader on substrate recognition by different types of RNase P enzymes.},

   abstract = {In recent years, obtaining RNA secondary structure information has played an important role in RNA and gene function research. Although some RNA secondary structures can be gained experimentally, in most cases, efficient, and accurate computational methods are still needed to predict RNA secondary structure. Current RNA secondary structure prediction methods are mainly based on the minimum free energy algorithm, which finds the optimal folding state of RNA in vivo using an iterative method to meet the minimum energy or other constraints. However, due to the complexity of biotic environment, a true RNA structure always keeps the balance of biological potential energy status, rather than the optimal folding status that meets the minimum energy. For short sequence RNA its equilibrium energy status for the RNA folding organism is close to the minimum free energy status; therefore, the minimum free energy algorithm for predicting RNA secondary structure has higher accuracy. Nevertheless, in a longer sequence RNA, constant folding causes its biopotential energy balance to deviate far from the minimum free energy status. This deviation is because of its complex structure and results in a serious decline in the prediction accuracy of its secondary structure. In this paper, we propose a novel RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm using a convolutional neural network model combined with a dynamic programming method to improve the accuracy with large-scale RNA sequence and structure data. We analyze current experimental RNA sequences and structure data to construct a deep convolutional network model, and then we extract implicit features of an effective classification from large-scale data to predict the pairing probability of each base in an RNA sequence. For the obtained probabilities of RNA sequence base pairing, an enhanced dynamic programming method is applied to obtain the optimal RNA secondary structure. Results indicate that our proposed method is superior to the common RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms in predicting three benchmark RNA families. Based on the characteristics of deep learning algorithm, it can be inferred that the method proposed in this paper has a 30\% higher prediction success rate when compared with other algorithms, which will be needed as the amount of real RNA structure data increases in the future.},

   abstract = {The diverse functional roles of RNA are determined by its underlying structure. Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of RNA structure would inform a broader understanding of RNA biology and facilitate exploiting RNA as a biotechnological tool and therapeutic target. Determining the pattern of base pairing, or secondary structure, of RNA is a first step in these endeavors. Advances in experimental, computational, and comparative analysis approaches for analyzing secondary structure have yielded accurate structures for many small RNAs, but only a few large (>500. nts) RNAs. In addition, most current methods for determining a secondary structure require considerable effort, analytical expertise, and technical ingenuity. In this review, we outline an efficient strategy for developing accurate secondary structure models for RNAs of arbitrary length. This approach melds structural information obtained using SHAPE chemistry with structure prediction using nearest-neighbor rules and the dynamic programming algorithm implemented in the RNAstructure program. Prediction accuracies reach ≥95\% for RNAs on the kilobase scale. This approach facilitates both development of new models and refinement of existing RNA structure models, which we illustrate using the Gag-Pol frameshift element in an HIV-1 M-group genome. Most promisingly, integrated experimental and computational refinement brings closer the ultimate goal of efficiently and accurately establishing the secondary structure for any RNA sequence. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: RNA secondary structure prediction methods based on probabilistic modeling can be developed using stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs). Such methods can readily combine different sources of information that can be expressed probabilistically, such as an evolutionary model of comparative RNA sequence analysis and a biophysical model of structure plausibility. However, the number of free parameters in an integrated model for consensus RNA structure prediction can become untenable if the underlying SCFG design is too complex. Thus a key question is, what small, simple SCFG designs perform best for RNA secondary structure prediction? Results: Nine different small SCFGs were implemented to explore the tradeoffs between model complexity and prediction accuracy. Each model was tested for single sequence structure prediction accuracy on a benchmark set of RNA secondary structures. Conclusions: Four SCFG designs had prediction accuracies near the performance of current energy minimization programs. One of these designs, introduced by Knudsen and Hein in their PFOLD algorithm, has only 21 free parameters and is significantly simpler than the others. © Dowell and Eddy; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Telomere repeats are synthesized by telomerase, a ribonucleic acid (RNA) - protein complex. Here, the cloning of the RNA component of human telomerase, termed hTR, is described. The template region of hTR encompasses 11 nucleotides (5′-CUAACCCUAAC) complementary to the human telomere sequence (TTAGGG)n. Germline tissues and tumor cell lines expressed more hTR than normal somatic cells and tissues, which have no detectable telomerase activity. Human cell lines that expressed hTR mutated in the template region generated the predicted mutant telomerase activity. HeLa cells transfected with an antisense hTR lost telomeric DNA and began to die after 23 to 26 doublings. Thus, human telomerase is a critical enzyme for the long-term proliferation of immortal tumor cells.},

The&nbsp;architecture of the piRNA pathway allows it both to provide adaptive, sequence-based immunity to rapidly evolving viruses and transposons and to regulate conserved host genes. piRNAs silence transposons in the germ line of most animals, whereas somatic piRNA functions have been lost, gained and lost again across evolution. Moreover, most piRNA pathway proteins are deeply conserved, but different animals employ remarkably divergent strategies to produce piRNA precursor transcripts. Here, we discuss how a common piRNA pathway allows animals to recognize diverse targets, ranging from selfish genetic elements to genes essential for gametogenesis. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have numerous crucial biological roles, particularly transposon silencing in the germ line. In this Review, the authors describe our latest understanding of piRNA biogenesis and functions across diverse species, highlighting how, despite the universal importance of transposon control, different species have evolved intriguingly distinct mechanistic routes to achieve this.},

For example, RNA can synthesize short fragments of RNA in a template-directed fashion and promote formation of peptide, ester and glycosidic linkages. However, no known activity fully represents one presumed by the 'RNA world' theory, and reactions such as oxidation and reduction have yet to be demonstrated. Filling these gaps would place the hypothesis on much firmer ground and provide components for building minimal forms of RNA-based cellular life. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

While these assemblies have numerous applications in nanoscale materials fabrication due to their nanoscale spatial addressability and high degree of customization, no easy-to-use graphical user interface software yet exists to deploy these algorithmic approaches within a single, standalone interface. Further, top-down sequence design of 3D DX-based objects previously enabled by DAEDALUS was limited to discrete edge lengths and uniform vertex angles, limiting the scope of objects that can be designed. Here, we introduce the open-source software package ATHENA with a graphical user interface that automatically renders single-stranded DNA scaffold routing and staple strand sequences for any target wireframe DNA origami using DX or 6HB edges, including irregular, asymmetric DX-based polyhedra with variable edge lengths and vertices demonstrated experimentally, which significantly expands the set of possible 3D DNA-based assemblies that can be designed. ATHENA also enables external editing of sequences using caDNAno, demonstrated using asymmetric nanoscale positioning of gold nanoparticles, as well as providing atomic-level models for molecular dynamics, coarse-grained dynamics with oxDNA, and other computational chemistry simulation approaches.},

   abstract = {Despite the critical roles RNA structures play in regulating gene expression, sequencing-based methods for experimentally determining RNA base pairs have remained inaccurate. Here, we describe a multidimensional chemical-mapping method called “mutate-and-map read out through next-generation sequencing” (M2-seq) that takes advantage of sparsely mutated nucleotides to induce structural perturbations at partner nucleotides and then detects these events through dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing and mutational profiling. In special cases, fortuitous errors introduced during DNA template preparation and RNA transcription are sufficient to give M2-seq helix signatures; these signals were previously overlooked or mistaken for correlated double-DMS events. When mutations are enhanced through error-prone PCR, in vitro M2-seq experimentally resolves 33 of 68 helices in diverse structured RNAs including ribozyme domains, riboswitch aptamers, and viral RNA domains with a single false positive. These inferences do not require energy minimization algorithms and can be made by either direct visual inspection or by a neural-network–inspired algorithm called M2-net. Measurements on the P4–P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme embedded in Xenopus egg extract demonstrate the ability of M2-seq to detect RNA helices in a complex biological environment.},

These distinct forms of virus-induced structures include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), found during viral infections as diverse and notorious as those of coronaviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses, or hepatitis C virus. Our understanding of these DMVs has evolved over the past 15 years thanks to advances in imaging techniques and modern molecular biology tools.

   abstract = {All retroviruses specifically package two copies of their genomes during virus assembly, a requirement for strand-transfer-mediated recombination during reverse transcription1,2. Genomic RNA exists in virions as dimers, and the overlap of RNA elements that promote dimerization and encapsidation suggests that these processes may be coupled3,4,5. Both processes are mediated by the nucleocapsid domain (NC) of the retroviral Gag polyprotein3. Here we show that dimerization-induced register shifts in base pairing within the Ψ-RNA packaging signal of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMuLV) expose conserved UCUG elements that bind NC with high affinity (dissociation constant = 75 ± 12 nM). These elements are base-paired and do not bind NC in the monomeric RNA. The structure of the NC complex with a 101-nucleotide ‘core encapsidation’ segment of the MoMuLV Ψ site6 reveals a network of interactions that promote sequence- and structure-specific binding by NC's single CCHC zinc knuckle. Our findings support a structural RNA switch mechanism for genome encapsidation, in which protein binding sites are sequestered by base pairing in the monomeric RNA and become exposed upon dimerization to promote packaging of a diploid genome.},
