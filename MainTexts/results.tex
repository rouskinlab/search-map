\subsection{Workflows of SEISMIC-RNA and SEARCH-MaP}

% In Figure 1, the RNA sequence is CAAUGUGCCAAAGGUCAU (18~nt).
% This sequence could fold into the structures
% ..(((..((...)).))) [P--R base pairs formed] and
% ((...))((...)).... [P--R base pairs unformed].

SEISMIC-RNA is all-in-one software for processing and graphing mutational profiling data (e.g. DMS-MaPseq~\cite{Zubradt2016} and SHAPE-MaP~\cite{Siegfried2014}), inferring alternative structures, and modeling secondary structures (Figure~\ref{wf}a).
Designed for modern experiments comprising many samples and reference sequences, SEISMIC-RNA can process as many samples in parallel as there are CPUs, at high speed with low memory and storage footprints.
Input files can be in (gzipped) FASTQ format (which SEISMIC-RNA preprocesses with Cutadapt~\cite{Martin2011} and aligns with Bowtie~2~\cite{Langmead2012}) or SAM/BAM/CRAM format~\cite{Li2009}.
SEISMIC-RNA ensures data quality with new algorithms that flag ambiguous base calls (e.g. deletions within repetitive sequences) and mask unusable reads and positions (e.g. with insufficient coverage).
To identify alternative structures, SEISMIC-RNA introduces a new clustering algorithm -- similar to DREEM~\cite{Tomezsko2020} yet able to cluster RNAs longer than the reads themselves -- enabling analyses of structure ensembles in long transcripts.
After computing chemical reactivities, SEISMIC-RNA can use them to model secondary structures with RNAstructure Fold~\cite{Reuter2010,Cordero2012} or to generate a variety of graphs -- including correlations between samples and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
This entire workflow can be run via the command line, while an additional Python interface enables highly customized analyses, making SEISMIC-RNA accessible yet applicable to many kinds of mutational profiling experiments.

In a SEARCH-MaP experiment, an RNA is assumed to fold into an ensemble of one or more structures (Figure~\ref{wf}b).
Searching for base pairs involving part of the RNA -- in this example, section P -- begins by binding an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to that part, which prevents it from base pairing (Figure~\ref{wf}c).
Separately, the RNA is chemically probed with (+ASO) and without (no-ASO) the ASO, followed by mutational profiling (MaP) and sequencing (e.g. DMS-MaPseq~\cite{Zubradt2016}).

	\caption[]{(Continued from previous page.) \textbf{(a)}~Workflow of SEISMIC-RNA. First, sequencing reads (in FASTQ files) are aligned to reference sequence(s). For every read, the relationship to each base in the reference sequence (i.e. match, substitution, deletion, insertion) is determined. In the next step, relationships are called as mutated, matched, or uninformative; and positions and reads are masked by user-specified filters. Reads can then be clustered to reveal alternative structures. The types of relationships at each position and in each read are counted and tabulated. SEISMIC-RNA can use these tables to predict RNA secondary structures or draw a variety of graphs including mutational profiles, scatter plots, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. \textbf{(b)}~This RNA comprises three sections (P, Q, and R) and folds into an ensemble of two structures: one in which base pairs between P and R form and one in which they do not. \textbf{(c)}~Hybridizing an ASO to P blocks it from base-pairing with R. \textbf{(d)}~Mutational profiles with (+ASO) and without (no-ASO) the ASO, computed as ensemble averages with SEISMIC-RNA. The \textit{x}-axis is the position in the RNA sequence; the \textit{y}-axis is the fraction of mutated bases (\textmu) at the position. Each bar in the no-ASO profile is drawn in two colors merely to illustrate how many mutations at each position come from each structure; in a real experiment, this information would not exist before clustering. The change upon ASO binding indicates the difference in the fraction of mutated bases (\textDelta\textmu) between the +ASO and no-ASO conditions. \textbf{(e)}~Mutational profiles of two clusters (top) obtained by clustering the no-ASO ensemble in (d) using SEISMIC-RNA, and scatter plots comparing the mutational profiles (bottom) between the +ASO ensemble average (\textit{x}-axis) and each cluster (\textit{y}-axis); each point represents one base in section R. The expected Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is shown beside each scatter plot.}
\end{figure}

Each structure theoretically has its own mutational profile, which is not directly observable because all structures are physically mixed in an experiment~\cite{Sherpa2015}.
The only directly observable mutational profile is of the ``ensemble average" -- the average of the structures' (unobserved) mutational profiles, weighted by the their (unobserved) proportions (Figure~\ref{wf}d, top).
The structure -- and thus mutational profile -- of section R changes when it base-pairs with P; by preventing such base-pairing, the ASO changes the ensemble average of R (Figure~\ref{wf}d, middle).
However, the ASO has no effect on section Q because Q never base-pairs with P.
Therefore, one can deduce that P base-pairs with R (but not with Q) because hybridizing an ASO to P alters the mutational profile of R (but not of Q).

Furthermore, the mutational profile of the structure in which P and R base-pair can be determined, even without knowing the exact base pairs.
This step involves clustering the no-ASO ensemble into two mutational profiles over section R -- each corresponding to one structure -- and comparing them to the +ASO ensemble average (Figure~\ref{wf}e).
Because the ASO blocks the P--R base pairs, the +ASO mutational profile will correlate better with that of the structure where P and R do not base-pair; in this case, cluster~2 correlates better.
Therefore, the mutational profile of cluster~1 corresponds to the structure where P and R base-pair.

%\subsection{SEARCH-MaP finds base pairs in ribosomal RNA}
%
%We first validated SEARCH-MaP using 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from \textit{E.~coli}.
%We obtained ground truth structure models from the Comparative RNA Web~\cite{Cannone2002} and selected two known stems.
%For each stem, we designed two ASOs, one targeting each side.
%

The known secondary structure of the 23S rRNA~\cite{Cannone2002} is drawn above the graph; base pairs with one side within the ASO target site are highlighted.}
%	\label{rrna}
%\end{figure}
%
%We folded the 23S rRNA with each ASO, performed DMS-MaPseq over the entire transcripts, and compared ensemble average mutational profiles with and without ASOs using SEISMIC-RNA (Figure~\ref{rrna}).
%Every ASO caused a prominent dip in the rolling Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) at its target site and the immediate vicinity, confirming that each ASO bound properly to the RNA.
%The ASO targeting positions 1,647-1,668 also caused a smaller dip in PCC around positions 1,987-2,045 -- coinciding with the 3'~side of a stem whose 5'~side was targeted by the ASO -- showing that this stem could be detected with SEARCH-MaP.
%Conversely, targeting the 3'~side of this stem with an ASO binding positions 1,978-2,010 caused a small -- though still above-baseline -- dip in PCC around position 1,670 (near the stem's 5'~side) and another around position 1,800 (the 5'~side of another stem targeted by the ASO).
%Shifting the ASO slightly downstream to target positions 2,042-2,076 maintained the dips in PCC around 1,670 and 1,800 while introducing new dips around positions 2,245, 2,435, and 2,630, which correspond to the 3'~sides of three stems within or close to the ASO target site.
%Binding an ASO to 2,429-2,452 -- the 3'~side of one such stem -- caused the PCC to dip around position 2,055 at the 5'~end of this stem.
%These results show that SEARCH-MaP could detect multiple stems ranging from 200 to 600~nt in 23S rRNA from \textit{E.~coli}.

\subsection{SEARCH-MaP detects and quantifies long-range base pairing in SARS-CoV-2}

Aside from ribosomes, many of the best-characterized functional long-range RNA base pairs occur in the genomes of RNA viruses~\cite{Nicholson2014}.
In coronaviruses, the first open reading frame (ORF1) contains a frameshift stimulation element (FSE) that makes a fraction of ribosomes slip into the -1 reading frame, bypass a 0-frame stop codon, and translate to the end of ORF1~\cite{Plant2008}.
Every coronaviral FSE contains a ``slippery site" (UUUAAAC) and a structure characterized as a pseudoknot in multiple species~\cite{Brierley1989,Herald1993,Plant2005b}.
For SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 80-90~nt segments of the core FSE have been shown to fold into a pseudoknot with three stems~\cite{KZhang2021,Roman2021,Jones2022}.
However, in intact SARS-CoV-2, the FSE adopts a different structure: one whose DMS reactivities could be recapitulated \textit{in vitro} with a 2,924~nt segment but not a 283~nt segment, suggesting long-range base pairs~\cite{Lan2022}.

To search for long-range base pairs explaining these results, we performed SEARCH-MaP on the 2,924~nt segment after adding each of thirteen groups of DNA ASOs tiling the entire transcript (Figure~\ref{tiles}a).
We used one pair of RT-PCR primers flanking each ASO target site to confirm binding (Supplementary Figure~\ref{sars2-tile-target}) and another pair flanking the 283~nt section of the FSE to assess its structure (Supplementary Figure~\ref{sars2-tile-fse}).

To quantify structural changes over the FSE, we calculated the rolling Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of the DMS reactivities between each sample and a no-ASO control (Figure~\ref{tiles}b).
The rolling PCC of a no-ASO replicate remained between 0.93 and 1.00 (mean~=~0.97), confirming the DMS reactivities were reproducible.
Besides ASO group 4 (targeting the FSE itself), the FSE structure was most perturbed by ASO group 9, targeting about 1~kb downstream.
Intervening ASO groups 6, 7, and 8 had no effect on the FSE.

This result is consistent with a proposed structure named the ``FSE-arch"~\cite{Ziv2020} comprising three long-range stems (Figure~\ref{tiles}a).
The two inner stems connect the FSE (on the 5' side) to the target site of ASO group 9 (on the 3' side); thus, ASO group 9 would have disrupted them and perturbed the FSE, as we observed.
For the outer stem, the 3' side lies within the target site for ASO group 10, but this group had no effect: the outer stem apparently did not form.
These results suggest both inner stems (but not the outer stem) of the proposed FSE-arch~\cite{Ziv2020} exist, explaining our previous finding that a 283~nt segment was insufficient to recapitulate the FSE structure \textit{in vitro}~\cite{Lan2022}.

To determine in what fraction of molecules the two inner stems of the FSE-arch form, we clustered reads from the 5'~side of the FSE-arch for the no-ASO control.
We found two clusters with a 43/57\% split and -- to determine if they corresponded to the two inner stems formed versus unformed -- compared their DMS reactivities to those after adding ASO group~9, which would block the two inner stems (Figure~\ref{tiles}c, top).
cluster~2 had similar DMS reactivities (PCC~=~0.95), indicating it corresponds to the stems unformed.
Meanwhile, the DMS reactivities of cluster~1 differed (PCC~=~0.64), suggesting it corresponds to the stems formed.

To further support this result, we leveraged the preexisting model of the FSE-arch~\cite{Ziv2020}.
If cluster~1 did correspond to the two inner stems formed, its DMS reactivities would agree well with their structures (i.e. paired and unpaired bases should have low and high reactivities, respectively), while those of cluster~2 would agree less.
We quantified this agreement using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (Figure~\ref{tiles}c, bottom).
The area under the curve (AUC) for cluster~1 was 1.00, indicating perfect agreement with the two inner stems of the FSE-arch; while that of cluster~2 was 0.57, close to no agreement (0.50).
This result further supports that clusters~1 and~2 correspond to the two inner stems formed and unformed, respectively.

	\label{tiles}
\end{figure}

If the RNA did exist as an ensemble of the two inner stems formed and unformed, the 3'~side of the FSE-arch would also cluster into states with the two inner stems formed and unformed.
We thus RT-PCRed and clustered the 3'~FSE-arch in the no-ASO control and +ASO group~4 and found -- similar to the previous result -- that the DMS reactivities after blocking the 5'~FSE-arch with ASO group~4 resembled those of cluster~2 (PCC~=~0.94) but not cluster~1 (PCC~=~0.80), while the structure of the two inner stems agreed with cluster~1 (AUC~=~1.00) but not cluster~2 (AUC~=~0.57) (Figure~\ref{tiles}d).
We concluded that the RNA exists as an ensemble of structures in which the two inner stems of the FSE-arch form in 47\% ± 4\% of molecules (Figure~\ref{tiles}e).

\subsection{The long-range stems compete with the frameshift pseudoknot in SARS-CoV-2}

To determine if the FSE forms other long-range stems, in lieu of the original outer stem of the FSE-arch~\cite{Ziv2020}, we modeled a 1,799~nt segment centered on the FSE-arch.
Although computationally predicting long-range base pairs is notoriously unreliable~\cite{Doshi2004,Nicholson2015}, we speculated that we could improve accuracy by incorporating the DMS reactivities of cluster~1 on both sides of the FSE-arch (Supplementary Figure~\ref{sars2-clusters-fold}).
For the innermost stem -- which we call long stem~1 (LS1) -- nine of thirteen structures (69\%) predicted using the cluster~1 DMS reactivities contained LS1, compared to five of eleven (45\%) using the ensemble average and four of twenty (20\%) using no DMS reactivities.
For the second-most inner stem (LS2), eight structures (62\%) predicted using cluster~1 contained LS2, while none did using average or no DMS reactivities.
Thus, the DMS reactivities corresponding to the long-range cluster enabled predicting the long-range stems more consistently, allowing us to refine our model of the long-range stems.

	\label{lnas}
\end{figure}

Our refined model based on the long-range cluster (Figure~\ref{lnas}a) included not only the two inner stems of the FSE-arch -- LS1 and LS2a/b -- but also two long stems (LS3a/b and LS4) absent from the original FSE-arch model~\cite{Ziv2020}, as well as alternative stem~1 (AS1)~\cite{Lan2022}.
To verify this model, we performed SEARCH-MaP on the 1,799~nt segment using 15-20~nt LNA/DNA mixmer ASOs for single-stem precision (Supplementary Table~\ref{asos1799sars2}).
Each ASO targeted the 3'~side of one stem, and we measured the change in DMS reactivities of the FSE (Figure~\ref{lnas}b).
ASOs targeting the 3'~sides of LS1 and LS2a perturbed the DMS reactivities in exactly the expected locations on the 5'~sides.
An ASO for the 3'~side of LS2b perturbed the FSE with more off-target effects, likely because this stem overlaps with pseudoknot stem~2 (PS2).
Blocking LS3b also resulted in a main effect around the intended location, with one off-target effect upstream, suggesting that other base pairs between the pseudoknot and this upstream region may exist.
Therefore, stems LS1, LS2a/b, and LS3b do exist -- at least in a portion of the ensemble.

LS2b, LS3, and LS4 of the refined model overlap all three stems of the pseudoknot (PS1, PS2, and PS3) that stimulates frameshifting~\cite{KZhang2021}.
To test whether these long stems actually compete with the pseudoknot, we made four possible models of the FSE structure by combining mutually compatible stems (Figure~\ref{lnas}c).
Then, we clustered the 1,799~nt segment without ASOs up to 6 clusters -- the maximum number reproducible between replicates (Supplementary Figure~\ref{sars2-compare-clusters}a) -- and compared each cluster to each structure model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) over positions 305-371, spanned by the pseudoknot (Figure~\ref{lnas}d, top).
We considered a cluster and model to be ``consistent" if the AUC-ROC was at least 0.90.
The locally nested model (AS1 plus PS2 and PS3) was consistent with three clusters totaling 52\% of the ensemble, while the extended model (AS1 plus all long-range stems) was consistent with one cluster (20\%).
No clusters were fully consistent with the pseudoknotted model, though the least-abundant cluster (7\%) came close with an AUC-ROC of 0.88.
The remaining cluster (21\%) was not consistent with any model, suggesting that the ensemble contains structures beyond those in Figure~\ref{lnas}c.

Adding an ASO targeting the 5'~side of AS1 reduced the proportion of AS1-containing states (extended and locally nested) from 72\% to 16\% (Figure~\ref{lnas}d, left; Supplementary Figure~\ref{sars2-compare-clusters}b).
In their place emerged clusters consistent with the pseudoknotted and truncated models, constituting 56\% and 20\% of the ensemble, respectively.
Meanwhile, adding an ASO that blocked the part of LS2b that overlaps PS2 eliminated the extended state (which includes LS2b) and produced one cluster (13\%) consistent with the pseudoknotted model (Figure~\ref{lnas}d, right; Supplementary Figure~\ref{sars2-compare-clusters}c).
Adding both ASOs simultaneously collapsed the ensemble into three clusters of which two (87\%) were highly consistent with the pseudoknotted model (Figure~\ref{lnas}d, bottom; Supplementary Figure~\ref{sars2-compare-clusters}d).
Since blocking the PS2-overlapping portion of LS2b increased the proportion of clusters consistent (or nearly so) with the pseudoknotted model -- both alone and combined with the anti-AS1 ASO -- the long-range stems did appear to outcompete the pseudoknot.

\subsection{Frameshift stimulating elements of multiple coronaviruses form long-range base pairs}

We hypothesized that other coronaviruses would also feature long-range base pairs involving their FSEs.
To search for such coronaviruses computationally, we predicted structures of 2,000~nt sections surrounding the FSEs of all 62 complete coronavirus genomes in the NCBI Reference Sequence Database~\cite{OLeary2016} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{contact_freqs}).
We selected ten coronaviruses, at least one from each genus (Supplementary Figure~\ref{ten-covs}a), based on with which bases the FSE was predicted to base-pair.
In \textit{Betacoronavirus}, SARS coronaviruses 1 (\verb|NC_004718.3|) and 2 (\verb|NC_045512.2|) and bat coronavirus BM48-31 (\verb|NC_014470.1|) because they clustered into their own structural outgroup; MERS coronavirus (\verb|NC_019843.3|), predicted to pair with positions 510-530; and human coronavirus OC43 (\verb|NC_006213.1|) and murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (\verb|NC_048217.1|), both predicted to pair with positions 10-20.
In \textit{Alphacoronavirus}, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (\verb|NC_038861.1|) and bat coronavirus 1A (\verb|NC_010437.1|), predicted to pair with positions 440-460 and 350-360, respectively.
In \textit{Gammacoronavirus}, avian infectious bronchitis virus strain Beaudette (\verb|NC_001451.1|), predicted to pair with positions 330-350.
And in \textit{Deltacoronavirus}, common moorhen coronavirus HKU21 (\verb|NC_016996.1|), which had the most promising long-range base pairs in this genus.

We screened each of these ten coronaviruses for long-range base pairs with the FSE by comparing the DMS reactivities of a 239~nt segment comprising the FSE with minimal flanking sequences and a 1,799~nt segment encompassing the FSE and all sites with which it was predicted to interact.
All coronaviruses except MERS coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 showed differences in their DMS reactivities between the 239 and 1,799~nt segments (Supplementary Figure~\ref{ten-covs}b), suggesting their FSEs formed long-range base pairs.

To locate base pairs involving the FSE in each coronavirus, we performed SEARCH-MaP on the 1,799~nt RNA segment using DNA ASOs targeting the vicinity of the FSE (Figure~\ref{covs}).
The rolling Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) between the +ASO and no-ASO mutational profiles dipped below 0.9 at the ASO target site in every coronavirus segment, confirming the ASOs bound and altered the structure.
To confirm we could detect long-range base pairs, we compared the rolling SCC for the SARS-CoV-2 segment to our refined model of the FSE structure (Figure~\ref{covs}, blue).
The SCC dipped below 0.9 at positions 1,483-1,560 and at 1,611-1,642, coinciding with stems LS2-LS3 (positions 1,476-1,550 within the 1,799~nt segment) and stem LS4 (positions 1,600-1,622).
These dips were the two largest downstream of the FSE; although others (corresponding to no known base pairs) existed, they were barely below 0.9 and could have resulted from base pairing between these regions and other (non-FSE) regions.
Near LS1 (positions 1,367-1,381), the SCC dipped only slightly to a minimum of 0.95, presumably because LS1 is the smallest (15~nt) and most isolated long-range stem.
Therefore, this method was sensitive enough to detect all but the smallest long-range stem, and specific enough that the two largest dips corresponded to validated long-range stems.

The target site of each ASO is highlighted on the SCC data and shown above each graph. Structures predicted with RNAstructure~\cite{Reuter2010} using no-ASO ensemble average DMS reactivities as constraints~\cite{Cordero2012} are drawn above each graph; base pairs connecting the ASO target site to an off-target position with SCC less than 0.9 are colored. For SARS-CoV-2, the refined model (Figure~\ref{lnas}a) is also drawn, with LS1-LS4 labeled.}
	\label{covs}
\end{figure}

We found similar long-range stems in SARS-CoV-1 and another SARS-related virus, bat coronavirus BM48-31.
Both viruses showed dips in SCC at roughly the same positions as LS2-LS4 in SARS-CoV-2, indicating homologous structures.
SARS-CoV-1 also had a wide dip below 0.9 at positions 1,284-1,394, corresponding to a homologous LS1.
Thus, three SARS-related viruses share these long-range stems involving the FSE, hinting at a conserved function.

In every other species except common moorhen coronavirus, we found prominent dips in SCC at least 200~nt from the ASO target site.
To determine what long-range base pairs could have caused those dips, we used RNAstructure Fold~\cite{Reuter2010} guided by the DMS reactivities of the no-ASO ensemble average~\cite{Cordero2012}.
We obtained models consistent with the SEARCH-MaP data for both murine hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Figure~\ref{covs}, orange); although the algorithm did not successfully predict the long-range stems LS2-LS4 in SARS-CoV-1, likely due to the unreliability of long-range structure prediction~\cite{Nicholson2015} and our reliance on ensemble average (rather than clustered) DMS reactivities (Supplementary Figure~\ref{sars2-clusters-fold}).
We conclude that long-range base pairing involving the FSE occurs more widely than in just SARS-CoV-2, including in the genus \textit{Alphacoronavirus}.

\subsection{Structure of the full TGEV genome in ST cells supports long-range base pairing involving the FSE}

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a strain of \textit{Alphacoronavirus 1}~\cite{Whittaker2018} that infects pigs and causes vomiting and diarrhea, often fatally~\cite{Liu2021}.
Due to the impacts of TGEV~\cite{Liu2021} and our evidence of long-range base pairs, we sought to model the genomic secondary structures of live TGEV.
We began by infecting ST cells with TGEV and performing DMS-MaPseq~\cite{Zubradt2016} (Figure~\ref{tgev}a).
The DMS reactivities over the full genome were consistent between technical and biological replicates (PCC~=~0.94-0.95, Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev_reps}a and~b), albeit not with the 1,799~nt segment \textit{in vitro} (PCC~=~0.76), which showed that verifying the long-range stem in live TGEV would be necessary (Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev_reps}c).

\begin{figure}[H]

	\label{tgev}

To quantify the long-range base pairs, we RT-PCRed the 5'~and 3'~sides, confirmed their DMS reactivities were consistent with the full genome's (Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev_reps}d), and clustered both sides (Figure~\ref{tgev}b).
Bases involved in the predicted long-range pairs were generally less DMS-reactive in cluster~2 (Figure~\ref{tgev}b, Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev-clusters}a), which we hypothesized corresponded to the long-range base pairs forming.
In support, the long-range stem (hereafter, LS3) appeared in structures modeled from the DMS reactivities from cluster~2 on both sides (Figure~\ref{tgev}c), but not cluster~1 (Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev-clusters}b).
The refined model based on cluster~2 included another long-range stem, LS2, which was also supported by a dip in the rolling SCC (Figure~\ref{tgev}c).

We used the ensemble average DMS reactivities to produce one ``ensemble average" model of short-range (up to 300~nt) base pairs in the full TGEV genome (Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev-full}).
To verify the model quality, we confirmed that the modeled structure of the first 330~nt included the highly conserved stem loops SL1, SL2, SL4, and SL5a/b/c in the 5'~UTR~\cite{Yang2015a} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev_5utr}a) and was consistent with the DMS reactivities (AUC-ROC = 0.97) (Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev_5utr}b).
The AUC-ROC was lower in many locations throughout the rest of the genome (Supplementary Figure~\ref{tgev-full}), indicating that a single secondary structure consistent with the ensemble average DMS reactivities could not be found -- which suggests alternative structures, long-range base pairs, or both~\cite{Lan2022}.
Accordingly, we found a large dip in AUC-ROC just upstream of the FSE, centered on the 5'~ends of LS2 and LS3, as well as smaller dips at the 3'~ends of both stems (Figure~\ref{tgev}d).
In fact, at or near every location that SEARCH-MaP had evidenced to interact with the FSE -- where the rolling SCC had dipped -- the AUC-ROC also dipped.
This finding supports that regions with low AUC-ROC in general are good starting points for investigating alternative structures and long-range base pairing with SEARCH-MaP.
