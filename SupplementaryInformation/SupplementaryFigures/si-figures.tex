Bases are colored by DMS reactivity. The model includes the conserved stem loops SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, SL5a, SL5b, and SL5c~\cite{Yang2015a}. The leader transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-L)~\cite{Alonso2002}, upstream open reading frame (uORF)~\cite{Nakagawa2016}, and start codon of ORF1 are also labeled.
