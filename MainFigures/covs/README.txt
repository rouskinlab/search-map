Files for the figure comparing 8 coronaviruses +/- ASOs.
Files of the pattern *-nrmsd.pdf were copied from Compute/covs-1.8kb/out/aso__and__noaso/graph/*/full/corroll_masked_m-ratio-q0_61-9_nrmsd.pdf.
Files of the pattern *-fold.db were copied from Compute/covs-1.8kb/out/noaso/fold/*/full/full_average.db; each file was then opened in VARNA and exported as an SVG to produce *-fold.svg.
The PDF and SVG files were then combined to make covs.svg.
