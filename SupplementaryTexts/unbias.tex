\section*{Computing the mutation rates that would be observed given real mutation rates}

Suppose that, for a sequence of length $L$, you know

\begin{itemize}
\item{the real (unobserved) mutation rate for each position $j$: $\mu_j$ ($0 \le \mu_j < 1$; $1 \le j \le L$)}
\item{the real (unobserved) fraction of reads that start at position $a$ and end at position $b$: $\eta_{ab}$ ($0 \le r_{ab} \le 1$; $1 \le a \le b \le L$)}
\end{itemize}

To reframe the problem in terms of probabilities, three events can happen:

\begin{description}
\item[$S$]{The read spans position $j$, i.e. $a \le j \le b$.}
\item[$M$]{Base $j$ is mutated in the read.}
\item[$G$]{The read contains no pair of mutations that are closer than the minimum gap $g$.}
\end{description}


You want to calculate the mutation rate that you would observe at each position $j$ due to the observer bias: $m_j$.
